    <title>Antiaging Potential of Lipophilic Extracts of Caulerpa prolifera</title>
    <year>2025</year>

    <abstract>The cosmeceutical industry has increasingly turned its attention to marine macroalgae, recognizing their significant bioactive potential as sources of natural compounds for skincare applications. A growing number of products now incorporate extracts or isolated compounds from various macroalgae species. However, many species remain underexplored, highlighting a valuable opportunity for further research. Among these, Caulerpa prolifera (Forsskål) J.V. Lamouroux has emerged as a promising candidate for cosmeceutical applications. This study provides the most comprehensive phytochemical assessment of C. prolifera to date, revealing its potential as a source of bioactive extracts and compounds. The analysis identified key components of its lipophilic profile, predominantly saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, alongside di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate—an endocrine disruptor potentially biosynthesized or bioaccumulated by the algae. While the crude extract exhibited moderate tyrosinase inhibitory activity, its overall antioxidant capacity was limited. Fractionation of the extract, however, yielded subfractions with distinct bioactivities linked to changes in chemical composition. Notably, enhanced inhibitory activities against elastase and collagenase were observed in subfractions enriched with 1-octadecanol and only traces of phthalate. Conversely, antioxidant activity diminished with the loss of specific compounds such as β-sitosterol, erucic acid, nervonic acid, and lignoceric acid. This work advances the understanding of the relationship between the chemical composition of C. prolifera and its bioactivities, emphasizing its potential as a source of cosmeceutical ingredients, leading to a more comprehensive valorization of this macroalga.</abstract>

    <title>Acute and repeated-dose oral toxicity evaluation of Caulerpa racemosa (Forsskål) J.Agardh ethanolic extract</title>
    <year>2025</year>
    <authors>Perdina Nursidika, Elin Julianti, Neng Fisheri Kurniati</authors>
    <abstract>Context: Caulerpa racemosa is a green alga showing significant potential as a medicinal raw material without any currently available associated safety information. Aims: To assess the safety of C. racemosa ethanolic extract (CRE) through oral administration to mice and rats in acute and subchronic stages. Methods: In the acute toxicity test, mice were divided into the control group, and a group was administered 5000 mg/kg CRE. Mortality and signs of toxicity were observed over 14 day period. For the repeated dose oral toxicity test, rats were divided into control, satellite, and treatment groups, each consisting of five rats.  The treatment groups received CRE at doses of 50, 350, and 1050 mg/kg b.w., respectively. The satellite group was observed for 35 days, while other groups were monitored for 28 days. Results: No mortality or signs of toxicity were observed in the animal subjects administered with acute and repeated-dose treatments. Additionally, the treatments did not result in statistically significant changes in body weight and relative organ sizes, compared to the control group. The hematological and biochemical analyses showed no substantial changes, with all parameters remaining within normal limits.  However, significant discrepancies were noted in the male animal group for red blood cell and platelet count, as well as alanine transaminase and triglyceride levels, although these values remained within normal ranges. Morphological examination of organs did not reveal any significant alterations.  Conclusions: Based on an LD50 value exceeding 5000 mg/kg body weight and all other results obtained, CRE was considered safe for consumption and could serve as a potential candidate for medicinal use derived from natural sources</abstract>

    <title>Natural pigment-based dye-sensitized solar cells utilizing Caulerpa racemose and Gymnogongrus flabelliformis as photosensitizers</title>
    <year>2025</year>
    <authors>Semuel Unwakoly, Liliasari Liliasari, Sri Hartati, Heli Siti H Munawaroh, Arramel Arramel, Prima Fitri Rusliani, Eka Cahya Prima</authors>
    <abstract>This research examines natural dyes' chemical and physical characteristics for potential use in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Chlorophyll pigments were extracted from two macroalgae species, Caulerpa racemosa and Gymnogongrus flabelliformis, and analyzed using absorbance spectroscopy, band gap energy calculations, and dye-sensitized solar cell performance evaluation. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) characterisation was used to identify the pigments contained in the dye. The absorbance spectra of chlorophyll pigments extracted from both macroalgae species showed broad peaks at 400–800 nm wavelengths, with Gymnogongrus flabelliformis showing the highest absorbance peak at 403 nm. The redox potential analysis for both macroalgae species showed energy gaps (HOMO/LUMO) of 1.3 eV, 1.4 eV, 2.3 eV, and 2.4 eV, respectively, indicating that these natural dyes are suitable for use in DSSC applications. DSSC devices were fabricated using components such as liquid electrolyte, mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO₂) photoelectrode, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as counter electrode, and ITO glass as conductive substrate. Meanwhile, to evaluate how well the photovoltaic system worked, we looked at short-circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and overall photoelectric conversion efficiency (η). The results showed that the highest performance for Gymnogongrus flabelliformis was Jsc 0.041 mA/cm², Voc 0.28 V, FF 0.239, and η 0.020%, while the highest performance of Caulerpa racemosa was Jsc 0.023 mA/cm², Voc 0.46 V, FF 0.244, and η 0.019%. These findings indicate the potential for using and developing natural dyes derived from these two macroalgae species in DSSC technology. This research offers insight into the feasibility of marine-derived pigments as a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative for photovoltaic applications.</abstract>

    <title>Nitrogen Budget and the Effects of Sea Grape (Caulerpa lentillifera) Density on the Water Quality and Growth Performance of Asian Seabass (Lates calcarifer) in a Polyculture System</title>
    <year>2025</year>
    <authors>Roongparit Jongjaraunsuk, Kanokwan Khaodon, Saroj Rermdumri, Alongot Intarachart, Wara Taparhudee</authors>
    <abstract>The nitrogen budget and the effects of varying densities of sea grape (Caulerpa lentillifera) on water quality and the growth performance of Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) in a polyculture system were evaluated. Four treatments were tested, each stocked with 20 fish (average weight: ~20 g; density: 2.66 kg/m3). Treatment 1 (control) contained no sea grapes, while treatments 2, 3, and 4 included 100, 200, and 400 g of sea grapes, corresponding to 0, 667 g/m3, 1333 g/m3, and 2666 g/m3, respectively. Significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05) reductions in total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), total suspended solids (TSS), and turbidity were observed with increasing sea grape density; however, no significant differences (p &amp;gt; 0.05) were found among the three sea grape treatments. Higher sea grape densities increased nitrite (NO2–N) and nitrate (NO3–N) concentrations due to enhanced nitrification. Approximately 65% of the nitrogen input originated from feed, but only 47.78–48.96% was assimilated into fish biomass. Nitrogen losses included 1.17–1.46% via water exchange and final drainage, while 45.27–50.76% was likely retained in sediments, volatilized, or lost through denitrification. Sea grapes effectively absorbed total nitrogen (TN), demonstrating their potential as biofilters for improving water quality without compromising fish growth performance. The optimal density was 100 g of sea grapes per 2.66 kg/m3 of seabass biomass, offering a sustainable strategy to enhance productivity while mitigating environmental impacts.</abstract>

    <title>POTENTIAL of Caulerpa lentillifera EXTRACT IN ENHANCING HEMOCYTE AND GROWTH BOOSTER IN SPINY LOBSTER (PANULIRUS HOMARUS)</title>
    <year>2025</year>
    <authors>Renanda Baghaz Dzulhamdhani Surya Putra, Muhammad Arifin Gymnastiar, Admiral Amin Supit</authors>
    <abstract>Challenges faced by lobster farmers in Indonesia include the high mortality rate of lobster larvae and the lengthy cultivation period. In previous studies, we successfully enhanced the immune system and growth of fish and shrimp using Caulerpa lentillifera extract. This study aims to analyze the effects of Caulerpa lentillifera extract on survival rate, growth, and immune system in Panulirus homarus larvae. The research method was experimental, using a Randomized Block Design (RBD) with treatments: control, Treatment 1 (10 gr/kg), and Treatment 2 (20 gr/kg), each with three replications over one month. The parameters observed were survival rate, growth rate, specific growth rate, total hemocyte count, and differential hemocyte count. The results indicated that Caulerpa lentillifera extract successfully improved survival rate and growth, as evidenced by increased survival rate, growth rate, specific growth rate, and an interesting food conversion ratio of around 1, with the best results in Treatment 2. Furthermore, Caulerpa lentillifera extract enhanced the immune system by increasing total hemocyte count and differential leukocytes (granulocytes, semi-granulocytes, and hyaline cells), with the highest values observed in Treatment 2.</abstract>

    <abstract>Caulerpa racemosa is a species of green seaweed that is widely distributed in almost all tropical seas in the world. Those green seaweed contain active compounds that have potential as antioxidants. Differences in phenolic and flavonoids content as antioxidants can be influenced by post-take handling and solvent polarity. The research aims to study the phenolic and flavonoid content in methanol (polar) and ethyl acetate (semi polar) solvents as well as the antioxidant activity using ABTS (2,2-azinobis-3-Ethylbenzoathiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl), and H2O2 (Hydrogen peroxide) methods. The highest extract yield was found in the methanol extract which amounted to 6.12%, while the ethyl acetate amounted to 1.80%. The phenolic content of the methanol extract was 40.18 ± 3.06 mgGAE/g, while the ethyl acetate extract had the lowest total phenol content of 17.22 ± 1.37 mgGAE/g. The total flavonoids content of the methanol extract was 84.42 ± 10.20 mgQE/g higher than the ethyl acetate extract which was 78.61 ± 5.31 mgQE/g. Antioxidant activity of ABTS method of methanol extract obtained IC50 value of 134.64 ± 19.90 µg/mL with the moderate category lower than that of ethyl acetate extract which was 113.50 ± 19.69 µg/mL also with moderate category. Antioxidant activity of DPPH method in methanol extract obtained IC50 reached 96.08 ± 0.45 µg/mL with strong antioxidant category, while IC50 in ethyl acetate extract reached 167.72 ± 1.08 µg/mL with weak category. The antioxidant activity of H2O2 method is classified as moderate activity in both solvents as in methanol extract it was 110.79 ± 2.52 µg/mL and in ethyl acetate extract was 123.67 ± 2.08 µg/mL.</abstract>

    <abstract>Abstract                  This study aims to evaluate the effect of dietary Caulerpa sp (Csp), Coconut/Copra Meal (CM), and Palm Kernel Meal (PKM) on blood profile, body weight of male laying hens. A total of 160 male laying hens DOC were used in this study until the age of 10 weeks and were randomly divided into ten treatments with four replications. The treatments given include: Control ration using Fishmeal, vegetable feed without Csp (TO), Ration without Fishmeal, Vegetable feed and Csp (T0C), Ration without Fishmeal, 10% CM, 10% PKM without Csp (T1), Ration without Fishmeal, 10% CM, 10% PKM and Csp (T1C), Ration without Fishmeal-20% CM without Csp (T2), Ration without Fishmeal, 20% CM and Csp (T2C), Ration Without Fishmeal, 20% PKM without Csp (T3), Ration without Fishmeal-20% PKM and Csp (T3C), Ration without Fishmeal, 15% CM, 15% PKM without Csp (T4), Ration without Fishmeal, 15% CM, 15% PKM and Csp (T4C). The results showed that the addition of Csp, CM, and PKM in the ration improved the blood profile of chickens, including haemoglobin, haematocrit, Leukocyte, Erythrocyte, platelet, total blood protein levels, meat antioxidant activity compared to the control group. Chickens given a ration containing Caulerpa produced the same body weight compared to the control group, while the use of vegetable feed combined with copra meal and palm kernel meal gave varying results on the performance of male laying hens. The use of 20% CM was better than 20% PKM in the ration. Chickens with low performance tend to have higher value of blood profile IC 50  in meat. The use of Caulerpa, copra meal, and palm kernel meal in the ration can affect the production performance of male laying hens, with varying effects depending on the type of additives used.</abstract>

    <title>Comparative Analysis of the Nutrient Composition of Caulerpa lentillifera from Various Cultivation Sites</title>
    <year>2025</year>
    <authors>Wenchuan Zhou, Yun Wang, Rui Xu, Jialin Tian, Ting Li, Suwen Chen</authors>
    <abstract>The nutrient, amino acid, and fatty acid compositions of Caulerpa lentillifera from various aquaculture regions were assessed to analyze their nutritional characteristics and potential for aquaculture development. The nutrient composition of C. lentillifera was determined according to the standard national nutrient determination methods of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, and the following data were revealed. (1) The basic nutritional components of C. lentillifera were relatively more abundant in the three aquaculture areas in Guangdong Province. The crude protein content in C. lentillifera was measured at (8.70 ± 0.36)% and (18.57 ± 1.59)% for samples collected from the Dapeng and Daya areas, respectively. These values were significantly higher compared to those obtained from the Beihai, Dongshan, and Nha Trang regions (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Additionally, the crude lipid content of C. lentillifera from the Daya population was measured at (5.10 ± 1.59)%, which was significantly higher than that of samples from the Beihai, Dongshan, and Nha Trang areas (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the total sugar contents in C. lentillifera were quantified as (32.50 ± 4.22)% and (32.87 ± 2.59)% for samples from the Daya and Shanwei regions, respectively. These values were significantly greater (p &amp;lt; 0.05) compared to those observed in the other four populations. (2) The total amino acid (TAA) content of C. lentillifera ranged from 7.05% to 12.37%, with notable concentrations of the fresh amino acids aspartic acid (Asp) and glutamic acid (Glu). Significant variations in the TAA and essential amino acid (EAA) levels were observed among the cultivation regions (p &amp;lt; 0.05), with the Shanwei population exhibiting the highest TAA content of 12.37% and EAA content of 4.65%, surpassing all other populations except for Guangdong Province (p &amp;lt; 0.05). (3) The fatty acid composition analysis revealed that the total fatty acid (TFA) and unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) levels in the long-stemmed grape fern alga from Daya were 2.400% and 1.048%, respectively, and significantly greater than those in the other populations except for Dapeng (p &amp;lt; 0.05). These results imply that the nutritional quality of the Daya population of C. lentillifera is relatively high. C. lentillifera exhibits a palatable flavor profile, making it suitable for consumption and the development into high-quality seafood condiments, thereby contributing to the environmentally sustainable advancement of C. lentillifera aquaculture.</abstract>

    <title>Analisis Penggunaan Berbagai Jenis Substrat untuk Pertumbuhan Caulerpa racemose Pada Pembudidayaan di Tambak Pasang Surut</title>
    <year>2025</year>
    <authors>Ros Erni Yanti, Andi Rahmad Rahim, Farikhah Farikhah</authors>
    <abstract>Substrat merupakan salah satu faktor penting untuk kehidupan dan pertumbuhan C. racemosa, namun saat ini belum ada studi substrat terbaik di tambak pasang surut.  Tujuan penelitian ini adalah menganalisis pertumbuhan Caulerpa racemosa yang dibudidayakan di tambak pasang surut dengan penggunaan jenis dan komposisi substrat yang berbeda. Metode penelitian ini adalah eksperimental dengan Rancangan Acak Lengkap (RAL).  Lima perlakuan di penelitian ini yaitu (A) lumpur 100%, (B) lumpur 50% : pecahan karang 50%, (C) lumpur 50% : cangkang tiram 50%, (D) lumpur 50% : pasir 50%, (E) lumpur 50% : pecahan karang 20%, : cangkang tiram 20% : pasir 10%. Variabel penelitian ini meliputi bobot mutlak, specific growt rate (SGR), panjang mutlak stolon, panjang dan lebar fronds, dan jumlah mutlak rizoid. Parameter kualitas air meliputi suhu, salinitas, kecerahan, kadar amonia, kadar nitrat, dan kadar pospat.  Data dianalisis mengunakan analysis of variance (ANOVA, α =5%) dengan program SPSS 16. jika nilai sig.&amp;lt;0,05 maka dikatakan perlakuan berpengaruh terhadap variabel penelitian sehingga dapat dilajutkan dengan menggunakan uji Tukey (α =5%). Hasil penelitian mendapatkan jenis substrat berpengaruh nyata terhadap variabel bobot mutlak, SGR, dan panjang mutlak stolon, dimana perlakuan tanpa substrat pasir (A, B dan C) menunjukkan pertumbuhan positif sedangkan perlakuan dengan substrat pasir (D dan E) menghasilkan pertumbuhan negatif pada variabel bobot mutlak dan SGR. Lebar frond, panjang fronds, dan jumlah rizoid tidak dipengaruhi oleh perlakuan substrat yang berbeda. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian disimpulkan bahwa penggunaan substrat lumpur dan pecahan batu karang menghasilkan pertumbuhan terbaik dalam bentuk bobot mutlak dan SGR, namun tidak berbeda nyata dengan substrat lumpur 100% atau lumpur dicampur pecahan cangkang tiram.  Penggunaan substrat berupa pasir kurang direkomendasikan digunakan di tambak pasang surut sebab memberikan bobot mutlak dan SGR negatif, serta panjang stolon dan morfometrik fronds lebih kecil daripada substrat tanpa komponen pasir.</abstract>

    <title>Variation of N and P Fertilizer Combination Ratios on the Growth and Morphology of Caulerpa racemosa in a Closed System Cultivation</title>
    <year>2025</year>
    <authors>Fadli Zainuddin, Sri Andayani, Mohammad Mahmudi, Muhamad Firdaus</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpa racemosa lives in waters with sand, coral and mud substrates, and is widely used by coastal communities as food. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers using Urea (NH2CONH2) and SP-36 (P2O5) with different concentration variations on the growth and morphology of C. racemosa. This research was conducted at the Brackish Water Aquaculture Fisheries Center (BPBAP) Takalar. C. racemosa was maintained in basin containers equipped with a water circulation system in each container. This research design uses a complete randomized design (CRD) with 5 treatments and 3 replicates. The treatment used were the following ratios of Urea and SP-36 fertilizer: A (100 : 0%), B (75 : 25%), C (50 : 50%), D (25 : 75%), and E (0 : 100%). The results indicate that the addition of nutrients to the closed cultivation medium using a combination of N and P fertilizers resulted in the highest growth rate of 2.2% per day in treatment C and the lowest growth rate of 1.64% per day in treatment E. While the stolon diameter and rachis length showed no significant differences, the distance between rachises in treatment B was significantly different (P&amp;lt;0.05) compared to other treatments. These data are useful for considering the optimal combination of urea and SP-36 fertilizers for the cultivation of C. racemosa.</abstract>

    <title>Fungistatic activity and mechanism of Caulerpa racemosa, Caulerpa lentillifera fractions and caulerpin metabolite against pathogenic fungi</title>
    <year>2025</year>
    <authors>Perdina Nursidika, Elin Julianti, Neng F. Kurniati</authors>
    <abstract>The increasing prevalence of azole resistance in various fungal species presents a significant concern, highlighting the urgent need for new antifungal agents. The aim of this study was to investigate the antifungal activity of fractions from Caulerpa racemosa, C. lentillifera, and caulerpin against three species: Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, and Candida albicans. The Caulerpa extracts were obtained through maceration with 96% ethanol, followed by fractionation using vacuum liquid chromatography. Antifungal activity was assessed using the broth microdilution method, while fungal growth kinetics were evaluated through time-kill curves. Bioautography was employed to identify inhibitory compounds, while liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) was utilized to detect the contents of the extracts and fractions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the fungal structure, and the absorbance at 260/280 nm was measured to evaluate the cell leakage. LC-HRMS identified numerous compounds in C. racemosa and C. lentillifera with antifungal activities, including fatty acids, terpenes, alkaloids, flavonoids, and coumarins. The results indicate that the fractions of both Caulerpa did not inhibit the growth of A. flavus and A. niger, but effectively inhibited C. albicans. Among the fractions, F3CR and F4CL exhibited the highest antifungal efficacy against C. albicans, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 64 to 128 µg/mL. Caulerpin, the primary metabolite of Caulerpa, also demonstrated significant inhibition, with an MIC of 256 µg/mL. The findings suggested that F3CR, F4CL, and caulerpin possessed fungistatic properties. Bioautography results revealed clear zones in the colonies, indicating inhibited fungal growth. The SEM observations showed that fungal cells became rough, perforated, and damaged, which was confirmed by the increase in absorbance at 260/280 nm, suggesting the release of cellular components such as nucleotides and proteins. In conclusion, both Caulerpa species and caulerpin are promising candidates for developing new antifungal agents against C. albicans.</abstract>

    <title>Shifts in sulphur-cycling bacteria in the rhizobiome support the adaptation of Caulerpa prolifera to elevated sulphide levels</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Anastasiia Barilo, Aschwin Engelen, Susanne Wilken, Harro Bouwmeester, Gerard Muyzer</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpa  is a genus of green macroalgae that lives in tropical and subtropical coastal waters. It is an intriguing organism because, despite having plant-like structures, it is one giant cell – which, next to multiple nuclei, chloroplasts, and mitochondria, also contains endo- and epiphytic bacteria. The role of these bacteria is unknown, but they might impact the growth and development of the host, adaptation to environmental parameters, and, hence, the ecological success of these algae. We hypothesised that increased sulphide concentrations would trigger a significant shift in the microbial community composition associated with  C. prolifera  rhizoids, favouring sulphide-oxidizing bacteria. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a mesocosm experiment incubating  C. prolifera  in sediments with different sulphide concentrations and analysed the algal photosynthesis, growth, and microbiome composition. While photosynthesis was not affected, the  Caulerpa  weight-based growth rate decreased linearly with increasing sulphide concentration. To analyse the microbiome, we extracted DNA and RNA from the fronds, rhizoids, and the accompanying sediments and performed 16S amplicon sequencing. The microbiome of the fronds was unaffected in both the DNA and RNA samples. However, an increase in sulphide concentration coincided with a decrease in the relative abundance of sulphate-reducing bacteria associated with  Caulerpa  rhizoids, particularly from the family Desulfocapsaceae. In the RNA samples, potential sulphide oxidisers of the rhizoid-associated members of the Beggiatoaceae were detected. Our results suggest that the rhizobiome of  Caulerpa  plays a significant role in its adaptation to sulphide-rich environments, offering new insights into the complex interactions within marine holobionts.</abstract>

    <abstract>The nutritional properties of five different green macroalgae including Ulva rigida, Chaetomorpha linum, Codium fragile, Caulerpa prolifera and Caulerpa racemosa f. requienii from Turkey were investigated. The chemical composition of green macroalgae was varied, with ash, crude fiber, protein, lipid and carbohydrate ranging from 40.71 to 52.82%, 12.02-17.56%, 4.40-26.19%, 0.57-3.85% and 4.58-42.28% in dry weight, respectively. The fatty acid contents of the algae were quite variable and palmitic acid (C16) was found to be the primary fatty acid for all the samples with a value of more than 49.61%. Palmitic acid was followed by oleic acid, which is a monounsaturated fatty acid. This study revealed that green algae are rich in important soluble carbohydrates such as myo-inositol and glucose, health promoting unsaturated fatty acids (mainly oleic acid) and essential macroelements such as potassium, magnesium and microelements such as iron, zinc and selenium. The results of the current study contribute to a better understanding of macroalgae and encourage their use in food-related applications.</abstract>

    <abstract>The aim of this study is to assess the concentrations of the studied metals in Caulerpa prolifera (Chlorophyta) species collected from different stations at the sites (BeniEnsar and KariatArekmane) of the Marchica lagoon in Morocco. The algae were collected in October and February 2020. Metal concentrations (ppm) in this species were ordered as follows: Fe (795.25) &amp;gt;Cr (254.69)&amp;gt;Zn (145.38)&amp;gt;Cu (76.86)&amp;gt;Ni (75.65)&amp;gt;Pb (74.82) &amp;gt;Cd (38.33). No significant variation was observed between the two seasons (P&amp;gt;0.05). Excluding Zn, the accumulation trends of the metals studied in Caulerpaproliferawere the same (P&amp;gt; 0.05) in the samples from the BeniEnsar sites as in those from KariatArekmane, as a result of the same characteristics in relation to environmental factors (areas classified as eutrophic and confined, with low hydrodynamics prior to the opening of the new inlet with the sea, and subjected to the same anthropic pressure). The alga studied is a suitable biomonitor for the study of heavy metal contamination in the Marchica lagoon, and more particularly in the sites studied due to their abundance and significant vegetative growth.</abstract>

    <abstract>Background:  Food poisoning caused by bacterial agents is a worldwide problem, usually accompanied by unpleasant symptoms and may be sever leading to death. Natural compounds from marine algae namely flavonoids may play a role in the remedy of this condition.  Aim:  This research aims to assess the potency of flavonoids extracted from Enteromorpha intestinalis and Caulerpa prolifera as antibacterial agents.  Methods:  E. intestinalis was collected from Western Libyan Coast and C. prolifera was collected from Farwa Island. The antimicrobial activity and determination of minimum inhibitory concentration of algal flavonoid containing extracts was performed in vitro against some positive and negative Gram bacteria. Results:  Crude extract containing flavonoids from E. intestinalis were more effective than C. prolifera extract against Staphylococcus aureus with antimicrobial essay (25-28+1 and 14.5-37.5+0.5-1.5), MIC (50 and 50-250 µg/mL), MBC (75 and 75-250 µg/mL). In Bacillus cereus, the antimicrobial assay (19-24.5+0.5-1.5: 24+1), MIC (50-250 + 100 µg/mL) and MBC (250 and 125 µg/mL). On the other hand, flavonoids containing extract from C. prolifera were more effective than E. intestinalis against Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157   EHEC O157 (25-28+1: 14-18.5+0.5-1.5), MIC (100-250:100-500 µg/mL) and MBC (150-250 and 250-500 µg/mL). Salmonella enterica qualitatively combat by flavonoid from E. intestinalis (13.5-14+0.5-1: 10.5-13.5+0.5-1.5), MIC (100-250: 250 µg/mL) and MBC (100-250: 250 µg/mL). Flavonoids from C. prolifera (4 strains: 2 strains) were effective against S. enterica. Crude flavonoids from both algae were not effective against Bacillus pumilus.  Conclusion:  Data from this study could conclude that flavonoid extracts from E. intestinalis and C. prolifera could be used against foodborne bacterial agents.</abstract>

    <title>Antibacterial activity of endophytic fungi Caulerpa racemosa against Vibrio parahaemolyticus in Vaname Shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei)</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Elsa Purwati, Rosa Amalia, Seto Windarto, Sri Rejeki, Dion Saputra</authors>
    <abstract>Vaname shrimp is an essential commodity in brackish water aquaculture and has high economic value. Infectious diseases are caused by bacteria of the genus Vibrio, one of which is Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and hinder the development of shrimp farming. The increasing bacterial resistance in aquaculture aggravates the situation. To overcome this problem, research into natural materials with new antibacterial activity is needed. Macroalgae are one of the natural materials suitable as a habitat for microorganisms, as they contain various organic substances that serve as nutrients for the growth of bacterial colonies or other microbes such as fungi. Therefore, this study aims to examine the antibacterial activity of endophytic fungi in symbiosis with Caulerpa racemosa against V. parahaemolyticus. C. racemosa from Karimun Jawa Island was isolated in PDA and incubated for seven days. After purification, five isolates showed antibacterial activity using the agar overlay method, and four isolates: C.1.BM, C.4.B, C.7.TM, and C.8.T, showed the best antibacterial activity. The result is that isolates C.1.BM and C.8.T belong to the species Aspergillus fumigatus, isolate C.4.B to the species Aspergillus oryzae, and isolate C.7.TM to the species Trichoderma reesei. The results of this study indicate the potential of the endophytic fungi C. racemosa to be used to prevent disease problems in aquaculture.</abstract>

    <title>Growth of Sea Grapes (Caulerpa lentillifera) in Laboratory-Scale Cultivation With Urea As A Single Nitrogen Nutrient</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Maulani Eviana, Alis Mukhlis, Fariq Azhar</authors>
    <abstract>Sea grape (Caulerpa lentillifera) is a strategic green macroalgae with significant potential in aquaculture and functional food industries. However, its cultivation remains constrained by limited production techniques. This study investigated the influence of nitrogen concentration on C. lentillifera growth in a laboratory-scale cultivation system. A completely randomized experimental design was implemented with four treatments: a control group (0 ppm) and nitrogen supplementation levels of 5, 10, and 15 ppm, each replicated thrice over 21 days. Results demonstrated a significant positive correlation between nitrogen concentration and growth parameters. The 15 ppm nitrogen treatment exhibited the highest absolute growth (3.37 g), relative growth rate (13.50%), and specific growth rate (1.82% per day). Interestingly, no statistically significant difference was observed between 10 and 15 ppm treatments, suggesting a potential nitrogen uptake saturation point. Water quality parameters remained stable throughout the experiment, with temperature ranging from 28-30°C, salinity at 33-34 ppt, dissolved oxygen between 5.9-6.7 ppm, and pH maintained at 7.5-7.8. The study provides crucial insights into nitrogen's role in C. lentillifera cultivation, offering a scientific foundation for developing more efficient and sustainable macroalgae production strategies in aquaculture and functional food industries.</abstract>

    <title>Morphological Identification of Balinese Caulerpa Seaweeds</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Ni Kadek Emi Sintha Dewi, I Gede Putu Wirawan, I Ketut Suada</authors>
    <abstract>Bulung boni and bulung anggur are species of Caulerpa seaweeds commonly found along the coastline of Serangan Island, Bali. Although these species have been widely utilized in various ways, formal species identification of these two macroalgae in Bali had not been conducted prior to this study. This research aims to characterize the morphological structures of bulung boni and bulung anggur through detailed morphological examination. Identification keys and previous studies were used to assist in the morphological identification process. The findings revealed that bulung boni shares morphological characteristics with Caulerpa cylindracea, while bulung anggur is morphologically comparable to Caulerpa macrophysa. These results provide valuable insights into the species composition of seaweeds in the region and contribute to a better understanding of local biodiversity.</abstract>

    <title>Characterization of High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE)-based Biocomposite with Green Seaweed Caulerpa lentillifera as Filler and Polyethylene-grafted-Maleic Anhydride (PE-g-MA) as Coupling Agent</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Desconocido</authors>
    <abstract>Indonesia possesses abundant seaweed resources; however, their use in composites remains limited. This study investigates the impact of incorporating green seaweed (Caulerpa lentillifera) as a filler and polyethylene-grafted-maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA) as a coupling agent on the mechanical, thermal, morphological, water uptake, and soil degradation properties of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) biocomposite. C. lentillifera content in the biocomposite was varied from 10% to 40%, PE-g-MA content ranged from 0% to 15%, and C. lentillifera particle size was also varied. Results indicate that adding C. lentillifera significantly increases the biocomposite's modulus of elasticity (up to 1.63 GPa), thermal stability, and soil degradation resistance (up to 15%). The incorporation of PE-g-MA (up to 5%) effectively reduces water uptake to 0.94%, slightly improves mechanical properties, and enhances interfacial adhesion compared to the un-compatibilized biocomposite. A smaller C. lentillifera particle size further decreases water uptake and soil degradation, reaching 0.45% and 1.13%, respectively.</abstract>

    <title>Elucidation of anti-human melanoma and anti-aging mechanisms of compounds from green seaweed Caulerpa racemosa</title>

    <abstract>Human melanoma is linked with aging-related disorders, prompting interest in the development of functional foods derived from natural ingredients to mitigate its incidence. Molecules in green seaweeds such asCaulerpa racemosacan serve this purpose due to their anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory properties. A previous work study compounds profiling has been carried out, and in this research the molecular docking studies targeting receptors associated with melanoma (GRP78, IRE1, BRAF) and aging (mTOR, AMPK, SIRT1) identified four promising compound in an extract ofC. racemosa. The current study aims to the mechanism of those compounds at a cellular level using the human A375 (BRAF-V600E mutation) and A375 and B16-F10 cell lines. The MTT assay was used to evaluate the potential of GSCRE compounds against A375 and B16-F10 cell lines, with comparisons made to normal HDFa cell lines. Results indicated that compound C2, also known as Caulersin, demonstrated a significantly different ∆G affinity binding score compared to the control drug Dabrafenib. GSCRE crude extract, particularly C2, showed potential in modulating mTOR, AMPK, and SIRT1 pathways and downregulating GRP78, IRE1, and BRAF signaling (p&lt; 0.05). Interestingly, C2 was less effective in suppressing A375 and B16-F10 cell lines (LD50C2 &lt; LD50Dabrafenib/control), with its LD50value nearly matching that of the Trametinib control in B16-F10 cell lines. Consequently, GSCRE, especially C2 or Caulersin, shows promise as a new molecule for developing functional foods to combat aging and human melanoma. However, further in vivo studies and clinical trials are necessary to confirm these findings.</abstract>

    <title>Antibacterial Properties in Fermentate Extracts of Endophytic Fungus Derived from Marine Algae Caulerpa lentillifera Against Gastrointestinal Pathogenic Bacteria</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Andi Sinrang Paliwengi</authors>
    <abstract>Endophytic fungi, residing symbiotically within living plant tissues, are a promising source of novel bioactive compounds. These fungi are known to produce secondary metabolites with a wide range of biological activities, including antibacterial properties. This study explored the antibacterial potential of fermented extracts from endophytic fungi isolated from the marine alga Caulerpa lentillifera, a food source consumed by coastal communities and traditionally used for medicinal purposes. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) bioautography was employed to identify extracts with activity against common gastrointestinal pathogenic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, and Salmonella typhi. Two endophytic fungal isolates displayed promising antibacterial activity against these pathogens. TLC analysis tentatively identified the presence of flavonoids and alkaloids, potentially responsible for the observed effects. This research sheds light on the pharmacological potential of endophytic fungi and their applications in combating bacterial infections.</abstract>

    <title>Analysis of Volatile Compounds in Caulerpa lentillifera for Anti-Proliferative Studies in HEPG2 Liver Cancer Cells and in silico Comparison</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Rammiya Rajasegaran, Asita Elengoe, Sau Pin Woo, Muhammad Ariffuddin Abd Hamd, Noorfatimah Yahaya, Shahrul Hamid</authors>
    <abstract>Background:Liver cancer remains a significant cause of mortality despite standard therapies. Recent studies have highlighted the anti-inflammatory properties and cancer prevention potential of certain agents.Caulerpa lentillifera (C. lentillifera)is known for its anti-inflammatory activity, yet there is limited understanding regarding its impact on liver cancer.Aim:Hence, this study aims to identify volatile compounds in C. lentillifera and associate them with cytotoxicity and molecular interactions involving the molecular marker SREBP-1A in liver cancer cells.Materials and Methods:Compounds present in the extract were identified using gas chromatography MS. Functional analysis involved proliferation and clonogenic assays. The interaction of the fatty acids with the biomarkers was assessed using AutoDock software.Results:The most abundant fatty acids identified were palmitic acid and tridecanoic acid. Cellular analysis revealed a dose-response antiproliferative effect on HepG2 cell growth, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1.2 mg/mL. Similarly, colony formation was significantly suppressed (p&lt; 0.05). In silico analysis demonstrated a higher affinity binding of palmitic acid to SREBP-1A compared to alpha-fetoprotein.Conclusion:The study suggests that palmitic acid exhibits antiproliferative activity in HepG2 liver cancer cells by binding to SREBP-1A. Further investigations are warranted to determine the regulatory effect of palmitic acid in liver cancer.</abstract>

    <title>Facile synthesis of ZnO/RGO/Fe2O3 using macroalgae Caulerpa taxifolia as green reductor and its application as malachite green removal</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Said Ali Akbar, Muhammad Hasan</authors>
    <abstract>This study presents the synthesis of a novel ZnO/rGO/Fe₂O₃ composite using Caulerpa taxifolia as a green reductant for the effective removal of Malachite Green from aqueous solutions. Characterization techniques, including FTIR, SEM, and XRD, confirmed the successful incorporation of ZnO and Fe₂O₃ onto the rGO matrix, enhancing its adsorption properties. The composite achieved an exceptional maximum adsorption capacity of 454.5 mg/g at pH 9, significantly outperforming rGO alone and other adsorbents. The adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo-second-order model, indicating chemisorption as the dominant mechanism, with a high correlation coefficient (R² = 0.999). The adsorption isotherms were best described by the Langmuir model, suggesting monolayer adsorption. Thermodynamic parameters revealed that the process was spontaneous and exothermic, with a Gibbs free energy (ΔGo) of -10.93 kJ/mol at 25 °C. The composite's high adsorption capacity, rapid kinetics, and favorable thermodynamics highlight its potential as an efficient and sustainable adsorbent for dye removal. This research offers a promising approach to water treatment, aligning with environmentally friendly practices and providing a viable solution for mitigating water pollution caused by organic dyes.              KEY WORDS: Reduced graphene oxide, Water treatment, Caulerpa taxifolia, Isothermal and kinetic studies, Malachite Green  Bull.

    <abstract>The escalating impact of human activities has led to the accumulation of microplastics (MPs) and heavy metals in marine environments, posing serious threats to marine ecosystems. As essential components of oceanic ecosystems, large seaweeds such as Caulerpa lentillifera play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance. This study investigated the effects of MPs and cadmium (Cd) on the growth, physiology, biochemistry, and Cd accumulation in C. lentillifera while elucidating the underlying molecular regulatory mechanisms. The results demonstrated that exposure to MPs alone significantly promoted the growth. In contrast, exposure to Cd either alone or in combination with MPs significantly suppressed growth by reducing stem and stolon length, bud count, weight gain, and specific growth rates. Combined exposure to MPs and Cd exhibited the most pronounced inhibitory effect on growth. MPs had negligible impact while Cd exposure either alone or combined with MPs impaired antioxidant defenses and exacerbated oxidative damage; with combined exposure being the most detrimental. Analysis of Cd content revealed that MPs significantly increased Cd accumulation in algae intensifying its toxic effects. Gene expression analysis revealed that Cd exposure down-regulated key genes involved in photosynthesis, impairing both photosynthetic efficiency and energy conversion. The combined exposure of MPs and Cd further exacerbated these effects. In contrast, MPs alone activated the ribosome pathway, supporting ribosomal stability and protein synthesis. Additionally, both Cd exposure alone or in combination with MPs significantly reduced chlorophyll B and soluble sugar content, negatively impacting photosynthesis and nutrient accumulation. In summary, low concentrations of MPs promoted C. lentillifera growth, but the presence of Cd hindered it by disrupting photosynthesis and antioxidant mechanisms. Furthermore, the coexistence of MPs intensified the toxic effects of Cd. These findings enhance our understanding of how both MPs and Cd impact large seaweed ecosystems and provide crucial insights for assessing their ecological risks.</abstract>

    <authors>Haolong Zheng, Weilong Zhou, Yaohua Shi, Shouguo Yang, Xianming Tang, Yi Xiong, Zhifeng Gu</authors>
    <abstract>This study successfully obtained sea grape extract through mechanical extraction methods, which is rich in active components. These primary active ingredients include high concentrations of crude polysaccharides, total phenolics, and flavonoids. Using two zebrafish models, we observed  significant skin moisturizing and repair effects of this extract. Further experiments demonstrated its remarkable anti-aging and skin tightening effects through the DPPH method and elastase inhibition assay. Additionally, the extract showed significant anti-inflammatory effects in a model  built on 3 dpf (days post fertilization) Tg (corola: EGFP) transgenic zebrafish. The extract’s safety and reliability were confirmed through a final dermal application test on rabbits. Furthermore, we also analyzed the possible mechanism of  Caulerpa lentillifera  extract skin care.  Overall, our research indicates that sea grapes hold tremendous potential as a novel natural ingredient for skincare. It is foreseeable that sea grapes will become an indispensable component in the future medical skincare market.</abstract>

    <title>Effects Of Drying Temperatures On Drying Rates And Proximate Composition Of Caulerpa Racemosa Dried Using The Tray Dryer</title>
    <year>2024</year>

    <abstract>This study examined the effects of different drying temperatures (50°C, 55°C, and 60°C) on the nutritional attributes of Caulerpa racemosa seaweed to improve preservation techniques. The seaweed's potential as a nutrient source and the challenge of preserving it were explored by drying samples at varying temperatures to assess the impact on quality. Proximate analysis of dried samples was performed to evaluate drying effects, measuring moisture, crude ash, fiber, fat, protein, and carbohydrates using the AOAC methods. This study aimed to find the most viable drying temperature that preserves seaweed quality through a comparative analysis between the three temperatures used in the drying process. The proximate analysis results were averaged and analyzed through statistical analysis (ANOVA and Tukey's HSD Test) to determine significant differences in the data. Samples dried at 55°C for 240 minutes had the lowest ash content (60.94%) and highest fat (1.64%), protein (10.22%), and carbohydrate (19.33%) levels, with a moisture content of 14.94%. The lowest moisture was in samples dried at 60°C, and the highest fiber at 50°C. Ash and protein contents differed significantly, while carbohydrates, fiber, and fat did not. The drying kinetics of the experiment also showed no significant differences when comparing the average moisture content and drying rate at different temperatures. Therefore, it is recommended to dry seaweed at 55°C as it preserves the seaweed's attributes the most. Drying at 50°C took 30 minutes longer and impacted the sample's composition. Further research is needed to identify the best drying parameters and conditions for C. racemosa.</abstract>

    <title>Phytochemical Screening, Antioxidant and Anti-Arthritis Potential of Decoction Extract from Caulerpa lentillifera</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Khemjira Jarmkom, Wanna Eiamart, Prakairat Tunit</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpa lentilliferaalso known as sea grape, is a green seaweed in the Caulerpaceae family known for its nutritional benefits and medicinal properties. This study aimed to examine the phytochemical compounds, total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, and antioxidant and anti-arthritis properties of sea grape decoction extract. The total phenolic content was measured using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, and the total flavonoid content was determined with the aluminum chloride colorimetric method. Antioxidant activities were evaluated using two methods: 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2’-azinobis-(3- ethylbenzothia-zoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS). The anti-arthritis activities were assessed using bovine-serum protein. The study identified that the extract contained flavonoids, saponin, terpenoids and coumarins, with the total phenolic content of 343.19 ± 9.86 μg gallic acid equivalents/ mg dry extract and the total flavonoid content of 268.48 ± 16.57 μg quercetin equivalents/ mg dry extract. The extract showed antioxidant activity with an IC50value of 309.05±5.91 μg/ml using the DPPH method and 572.33±3.47 μg/ml using the ABTS method, respectively. Additionally, it exhibited anti-arthritis properties with an IC50value of 54.60±12.71 μg/ml, which was less than 1.69 times the IC50value of diclofenac sodium. A strong positive correlation was found between the antioxidant and anti-arthritis activities measured by the ABTS method, with an R² value of 0.9476. Therefore, this study provides initial evidence supporting the antioxidant and anti-arthritis activities of sea grape decoction extract. The extract shows potential for further development as a product for treating arthritis.</abstract>

    <abstract>Seaweed is an increasingly recognized source of secondary metabolites with a significant role as a plant biostimulant. With the rising popularity of organic farming, there is a pressing need to investigate the utilization of organic solvents derived from natural sources for seaweed extraction. Understanding the composition of these extracts is crucial for elucidating their role as biostimulants in plant growth. Hence, the present study aimed to explore the phytochemical composition and untargeted metabolomics of four extracts of  Caulerpa racemosa  (SW), prepared organically using vinegar, fermented buttermilk, and cow urine, in comparison with the conventionally used solvent, water. Approximately 95 volatile metabolites that belong to 22 chemical classes were identified through GC–MS analysis. The major classes detected include benzene and its substituted derivatives (24%), fatty acyls (17%), phenols (12%), benzofurans (8%), organo-oxygen compounds (6%), steroids and steroid derivatives (5%), and indole and its derivatives (4%). A significant shift in the composition of volatile metabolites was observed among the organic extracts as determined through a combination of various statistical analyses. A principal component analysis (PCA) highlighted seven principal components (PCs), which accounted for 99.9% of the total variance. Hierarchical cluster analysis delineated two distinct clusters, which signify a clear differentiation among the organic extracts. Furthermore, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) highlighted 49 volatile metabolites of significant importance, evident from variable importance in projection (VIP) scores of more than 1. These results underscore the intricate and distinct metabolomes inherent in  Caulerpa racemosa  organic extracts, hinting at their potential as biostimulants for plant growth. This study establishes a foundation for deeper investigations into seaweed extraction utilizing easily accessible organic solvents, presenting potential benefits for farmers.</abstract>

    <abstract>The seaweed Caulerpa racemosa has great potential to be developed because it has economic value and potential as a functional food. This seaweed contains nutrients, including protein, carbohydrates, polyunsaturated fatty acids, fiber minerals, and antioxidants. The availability of seaweed is still very dependent on nature and has not been appropriately cultivated. The planting season and appropriate cultivation methods will influence seaweed's quality/nutritional content. This research aims to analyze the nutritional content of seaweed C. racemosa cultivated in different growing seasons. The research method used a floating raft system with a completely randomized design and a factorial pattern carried out in two seasons, namely the dry and rainy seasons. Proximate analysis was carried out to determine the nutritional composition of seaweed C. racemosa, including protein, crude fiber, water, ash, fat, and carbohydrate (NFE). Next, it was analyzed using ANOVA with a further test with Tukey. The research results showed differences in the nutritional composition of seaweed C. racemosa from each treatment cultivated in the dry and rainy seasons. The nutritional composition of seaweed C. racemosa best treatment is found in the plant spacing of 30 cm with a depth of 50 cm in the dry season with the nutritional content namely protein (13.8%), NFE (20.75%), crude fiber (15.71%), a fluctuating fat content of 0.16-1.42%, highest ash (34.69%), water content (35%), moderate in the rainy season namely: protein (10.8%), BETN (10.78%), crude fiber (12.33%), fat content fluctuates (0.18-1.06%), highest ash (30.21%), water content (41.01%).</abstract>

    <title>Potential of Antioxidant Activity Caulerpa racemosa Extract Using DES Solvent and Different Sonication Times as An Antibacterial  Against Pathogenic Bacteria</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Woro Hastuti Satyantini, Akhmad Taufiq Mukti, Saiful Bakhri</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpa racemosa, a type of green algae, has been studied  for its potential health benefits, including antioxidant and an- tibacterial properties. The extraction of bioactive compounds  from marine algae using green solvents like Deep Eutectic Sol- vents (DES) has gained interest due to their efficiency and en- vironmental friendliness. This research aimed to determine  the potential antioxidant activity of C. racemosa extract using DES solvents and different sonication times as an antibacterial  against pathogenic bacteria. The research employed a Facto- rial Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with two variables:  sonication time (10, 20, and 30 minutes) and different DES solvents (ethanol and ethylene glycol (1:20) with 90% aquades, and methanol and glycerol (1:10) with 90% aquades. The highest antioxidant activity was found in DES  Methanol-Glycerol (36.39 mg TE/g dw), followed by DES Eth- anol-Ethylene glycol (28.30 mg TE/g dw), both significantly  different (p&amp;lt;0.05). The C. racemosa extract inhibited the growth of V. parahaemolyticus with an inhibition zone of 8.08 mm at 50 ppm and 13.13 mm at 1,000 ppm. For V. harveyi, inhibition started at 6.37 mm at 50 ppm, reaching 11.70 mm  at 1,000 ppm. DES Methanol-Glycerol with a 10-minute soni- cation provided the highest antioxidant activity and effectively  inhibited V. parahaemolyticus and V. harveyi. Extraction of C. racemosa with DES-MG solvent and varying sonication times influences its antioxidant activity and antibacterial properties.</abstract>

    <title>The effect of sea grapes (Caulerpa racemosa) powder drink on improvement of
obesity biomarker in Wistar rats</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>D.S. Damayati, E. Damayanthi, H. Riyadi, I.W.T. Wibawan, E. Handharyani</authors>
    <abstract>Obesity has become a global public health issue due to its rapidly increasing prevalence. Sea grapes powder drink (SPD) as a functional food has the potential to become an important biomarker in the improvement of obesity. The biomarkers in obesity can be assessed by Lee’s index and lipid profile. Due to its high antioxidant content, SPD can improve both Lee’s index and lipid profile. The objective of this study was to analyse the effect of SPD on the obesity biomarkers of Wistar rats. In this research, a completely randomized design that involved 24 male rats weighing between 150–250 g was used. Rats were randomly put into six groups. Biomarkers were measured using Lee’s index, lipid profile and the weight ratio of both visceral fat and liver. Results after 21 days of intervention showed a reduction in Lee’s index in the group that was given HFD + SPD 1 g, 1.5 g and 2 g. The visceral fat weight ratio in HFD + SPD 1.5 g and 2 g group significantly decreased. However, it had no effect on the liver weight ratio. Levels of Total Cholesterol (TC), Triglyceride (TG), and Cholesterol-Low Density Lipoprotein (CLDL) in the HFD + SPD 1 g, 1.5 g and 2 g group significantly decreased. The Cholesterol -High Density Lipoprotein (C-HDL) dramatically increased HFD + SPD 2 g group. SPD is effective in improving Lee's index, visceral fat weight ratio and lipid profile but not liver weight ratio. SPD can be used as an alternative therapeutic product in the management of obesity and consequent reduction of its prevalence.</abstract>

    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Desconocido</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpa racemosais a type of green algae recognised for its ability to inhibit the growth of bacteria and its potential to combat breast cancer. The algae are composed of several bioactive chemicals, such as flavonoids, phenols, tannins, saponins, steroids, alkaloids, and terpenoids. Hence, this study aimed to ascertain the antibacterial and anti-breast cancer properties ofCaulerpa racemosaextract obtained from the Minahasa Peninsula, notably the North and Southeast water regions. The anticancer test assessed the algae extract cytotoxicity against MCF7 breast cancer cells using the MTT assay for direct measurements. The antibacterial test employed the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. The findings indicated that the extract ofCaulerpa racemosacollected from the water in North Minahasa exhibited a potent antibacterial activity. The substantial antibacterial action of the substance was demonstrated by an average inhibition zone of 13.5 mm against Mycobacterium smegmatis at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, the highest concentration tested. The extract from water in the North and Southeast Minahasa regions exhibited significant anticancer activity, with IC50 values of 149.9 ppm and 313.2 ppm, respectively.</abstract>

    <abstract>The global push towards cleaner energy sources has heightened the demand for high-performing, durable proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) electrocatalysts. Green hydrogen, generated through water electrolysis powered by renewable energy, stands as a prominent solution in this endeavor to transition away from fossil fuels. Among various electrolyzer technologies, PEMWE systems currently offer the most competitive pathway for green hydrogen production. These systems typically employ a platinum on carbon supported (Pt/C) cathodic electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and an iridium oxide (IrOx) anodic electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Efforts to enhance PEMWE performance primarily focus on improving the kinetics of the OER process, which accounts for the majority of activation overpotential during operation. To address cost concerns associated with IrOx, researchers are exploring alternative formulations, including doping with materials like niobium (Nb), aiming for comparable performance at reduced Ir loading [1], [2], [3]. It is argued that higher surface area and lower crystalline IrOx catalysts lead to lower activation overpotentials and enhanced durability, respectively. In this study, we investigate the performance of high-surface-area IrOx electrocatalysts (&gt;200 m2/g) and Nb-doped IrOx variants, comparing them with commercially available benchmarks. Through rigorous examination utilizing Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE), Gas Diffusion Electrode (GDE) half-cell, and Membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEAs), we report on the performance and stability of our in-house prepared materials. Preliminary results examining various loadings of IrOx suggest that lower loadings lead to durable and active electrocatalyst layers. Our findings underscore the potential of Nb-doped IrOx as a cost-effective alternative for PEMWE electrocatalysts, offering promising advancements in the pursuit of efficient and sustainable hydrogen production.

    <title>Study of Bioaccumulation of Heavy Metals Mercury (Hg) and Tin (Sn) in Traditional Seaweed (Caulerpa racemosa) Cultivation in Brondong, Lamongan</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>R Dimar Herfano Akbar, Sapto Andriyono</authors>
    <abstract>Abstract                  Organisms such as  Caulerpa racemosa  seaweed, which play a pivotal role as primary producers in marine ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of heavy metal exposure. Thus, comprehending the levels of heavy metals, in conjunction with parameters such as the bioconcentration factor (BCF) and geoaccumulation index (Igeo), pertaining to mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) within the sediment and  C. racemosa  seaweed in Brondong, Lamongan is imperative for safeguarding the safety of seaweed-derived food products. Sampling of  C. racemosa  was conducted within traditional seawater ponds utilized for the cultivation of giant groupers, alongside other varieties of seaweed. The concentrations of heavy metals in various anatomical components of the seaweed (ramuli, stolons, rhizoids) and sediment were determined through spectrophotometric analysis utilizing Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrophotometer (ICP-MS). Laboratory analyses disclosed mercury (Hg) concentrations in  C. racemosa  ranging from 0.0212 ppm in rhizoids to 0.00437 ppm in ramuli, whereas tin (Sn) concentrations exhibited variability from 0.0392 ppm in rhizoids to 0.0390 ppm in ramuli. While mercury remained undetectable in sediment samples, moderate concentrations of tin were observed at approximately 2.10 ppm. The calculated bioconcentration factors (BCF) for tin in different segments of  C. racemosa  ranged from 0.0187 ppm to 0.0114 ppm, suggesting a low degree of bioaccumulation. Geoaccumulation index (Igeo) values spanned from -4.1876 to -4.2186 across distinct segments of  C. racemosa , indicating marginal accumulation of heavy metals.</abstract>

    <abstract>This study investigated six wall composition material substitutes employed in constructing Egypt's Ibny Baitak Project for their potential environmental impact. Clay brick (20 cm ), cement brick (20 cm ), and autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) (20 𝑐𝑚 ) blocks were the four materials evaluated. Each wall material is reinforced with (4 cm extruded polystyrene (XPS) insulation in the fourth, fifth, and sixth scenarios. The study used a life cycle assessment (LCA) technique to assess the environmental impact of these products from cradle to gate, including raw material extraction, processing, and transportation. The outcomes showed that the environmental effects of the four materials varied greatly regarding the three impact categories of potential global warming, non-renewable energy use, and respiratory pollution. Regarding the midpoint result, the AAC ranked second by 1.49 𝑝𝑡 , followed by the cement bricks by 2.25 pt , with the clay brick recording the lowest environmental effect. The environmental impacts in the three final scenarios increased by 1.24 pt , 1.86 𝑝𝑡 , and 2.55 𝑝𝑡 , and an incremental rate of 13% when the XPS was added to the three wall types. The 20 𝑐𝑚 cement brick recorded the highest value, 8.40K KG Co 2 e, and the 4 cm XPS + 20 𝑐𝑚 cement brick composition recorded the lowest value, 1.97K KG Co 2 e. When considering the endpoint results, the cement brick recorded the highest values by 8.40K 𝐾𝐺 𝐶𝑜 2 e, which show climate change has the most significant impacts. Regarding the resource's depletion impact, cement bricks recorded the highest values with 138.42K Mj primay . The study's findings provide important details regarding the environmental effects of composition wall materials. They can influence decisions made in the construction sector, favoring greener building practices. © 2024 Published by Faculty of Engineering – Sohag University.

    <title>MEASUREMENT OF THE HEAVY METAL CONTENT OF ZINC (Zn) and COPPER (Cu) FROM THE GREEN SEAWEED Caulerpa taxifolia and Caulerpa racemosa</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Bhayu Gita Bhernama</authors>
    <abstract>Aceh has a great potential in coastal areas because Aceh has a large source of marine biota, especially seaweed. The coast that has great potential for seaweed growth is Ulee Lheue Beach. Ulee Lheue Beach is a tourist area and port, so it tends to be exposed to heavy metals. Seaweed can absorb heavy metals easily and is used as a bioindicator of environmental pollution. The aim of this research was to measure the heavy metal content of Cu and Zn from the green seaweeds Caulerpa taxifolia and Caulerpa racemosa. The research method was carried out using a hydrothermal analysis digestion process using a hydrothermal-microwave analysis tool for 30 minutes. Metal content was analyzed using an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (SSA). The results showed that the levels of heavy metals of Zn and Cu in Caulerpa taxifolia seaweed were 11.05 and 3.65 ppm. Furthermore, the levels of heavy metals Zn and Cu in the seaweed Caulerpa racemosa were 18.46 and 12.26 ppm. It can be concluded that Caulerpa taxifolia and Caulerpa racemosa can absorb heavy metals.</abstract>

    <title>Peptide Analysis of Protein Extracts from Caulerpa Lentillifera by Nano LC-ESI-Ms/Ms and Their Potential as Precursor of Biologically Active Peptides – In Silico Approach</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Fisal Ahmad</authors>
    <abstract>Peptidomics research is gradually positioning in food science fields due to an increasing interest in peptides released from food proteins with health benefits and nutraceutical properties. Referable to the complexity of these compounds, their study requires advanced analytical techniques such as tandem mass spectrometry. Seaweed naturally has high nutritional value and many health-promoting effects. Hence, this work aimed to characterize the peptide and to virtual screening for their potential as a precursor of biologically active peptides. The total soluble protein was extracted from Caulerpa lentillifera using the phenol ammonium acetate precipitation method. In solution, digestion was carried out using trypsin on 500 µg of protein. Peptide sequencing was accomplished using nano liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-ESI-MS/MS), and Peaks Studio 7 was used for the analysis of MS/MS data and de novo peptide sequencing using an average local confidence above 90%. The results showed that 76 peptides mapped to selected proteins and 145 were de novo peptide sequences. In silico approaches of both peptide sequences resulted in 15 types of biological activity characteristics of peptides from among 44 categories as listed in the BIOPEP-UWM database, and motifs with the ACE inhibitory activity occur most frequently. These findings are relevant to the search for bio-functional ingredients as constituents of functional foods or provide added value to nutraceutical foods. Significantly, the methodology described here might apply to discovering the potential in any organism with incomplete genome data.</abstract>

    <abstract>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the prevailing kind of arthritis, impacting a substantial number of individuals globally. The incidence of OA is on the rise and is projected to further increase due to the aging population and escalating rates of obesity. This study aims to evaluate the anti-OA potential of Caulerpa racemosa. The Caulerpa racemosa 96 % ethanol extract of the plant was analysed using LC-MS/MS. The metabolite compositions were identified as polyunsaturated fatty acids, terpenes, bisindole alkaloids and diterpenoids. The 18 compounds analysed by LC-MS/MS, and the binding affinity of the compounds to the target proteins Interleukin-1 (PDB ID: 1ITB) was assessed by molecular docking fucosterol (∆G = –8.29 kcal/mol), variolin A (∆G = –8.02 kcal/mol), and clionasterol (∆G = –7.50 kcal/mol) and Nitric Oxide Synthase Inducible (3E7G) was assessed by molecular docking. Brassicasterol (∆G = –9.25 kcal/mol), fucosterol (∆G = –9.20 kcal/mol) and 24-methylenecholesterol (∆G = –9.04 kcal/mol) exhibited the highest docking scores, indicating their strong potential as inhibitors of IL1β and nitric oxide (NO). This knowledge is valuable for the future bioassay investigations about the possible applicability of these medicines as innovative solutions for OA.</abstract>

    <abstract>Mosques, being public spaces, should be designed with the needs and preferences of the wider community in mind in order to facilitate spiritual practice and convenience. Through face-to-face interviews, mosque users have expressed a desire for a range of specific characteristics in their places of worship, further highlighting the importance of incorporating user input into the design process. The study aims to examine the design features of various mosques and assess their compliance with user preferences, with the broad goal of ensuring that mosques are capable of addressing their functional role. A field survey of six mosques was carried out. The findings show that mosque designers have not fully considered these preferences, resulting in a relative discrepancy between user preferences and actual mosque designs, which introduces concerns about the effectiveness and functionality of mosque spaces. Accordingly, the study recommends active community engagement in the design process from the early stages and emphasizes the need for retrofitting current mosques to address design deficiencies. In this context, the findings are useful for identifying areas for improvement for current and future mosques. They can also be utilized as a practical guideline for architects, designers, and other stakeholders involved in the mosque building process. © 2024 Published by Faculty of Engineering – Sohag University.

    <title>Optimization of bio-oil production from macroalgae, caulerpa lentillifera via hydrothermal liquefaction</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>M Y Ong, N L Azmi, S Nomanbhay</authors>
    <abstract>Abstract                  An environmentally friendly method of producing bio-oil through the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of algae has emerged, providing a path toward renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Algae is currently received a lot of interest as biomass feedstock due to its long growing season in warm climate area, does not require arable land, and relatively rapid growing rate. This study aims to optimize the HTL process of macroalgae ( Caulerpa lentillifera ) for bio-oil production, focusing on optimizing the bio-oil yield based on three parameters (operating temperature, the loading size of catalyst sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and algae-to-water ratio) using Box Behnken Design (also generally known as Response Surface Methodology). The results showed that an ideal reaction temperature of 277 °C, a 1:10 algae-to-water ratio, and 0.88 wt% catalyst loading led to an optimal experimental bio-oil yield of 11.65 wt%. Sensitivity study also revealed that the temperature is the second most important component, after the algae-to-water ratio. The difference in the catalyst loading showed low impact on the HTL of algae. Slight improvement to the bio-oil yield under the presence of NaOH is mainly due to the alkali environment provided by NaOH. The FTIR spectrum revealed the existence of various functional groups in the bio-oil. In summary, HTL has been effective in turning  Caulerpa lentillifera  into useful bio-oil. Overall, this study contributes to the growing body of research on algae-based bio-oil production. The results highlighted the potential of HTL as a promising technology for sustainable biofuel production, offering a pathway towards a greener and more energy-efficient future.</abstract>

    <abstract>To maintain the cultivation of sea grapes while developing the tourism potential of the YTR area, an effort is needed to develop a sea grape cultivation area that provides unique value and new experiences to visitors or tourists how to learn to love the environment, especially aquatic ecosystems through educational tourism. The goal is to conserve sea grape resources that have economic value for the community and increase public awareness of the availability of resources in nature, train students to apply the knowledge gained in lectures to the community and build an entrepreneurial spirit from an early age. The training provided to the community consisted of: 1). Entrepreneurship counselling; 2). Training on making cultivation containers (quadrant nets) and sea grape cultivation (lat) to support educational tourism in the YTR area. The construction of sea grape cultivation containers in the form of frames / quadrants was carried out by Polikant students, then the results were socialised to the Letman community and the YTR Pokdarwis group and then worked together at the cultivation site in the YTR tourist area. The evaluation results showed positive feedback from the community and the product was developed into one of the souvenirs of the YTR Letman tourist</abstract>

    <title>Komposisi Kimia, Profil Asam Amino dan Kualitas Protein Caulerpa lentillifera Hasil Budidaya pada Wadah Terkontrol</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Nopa Aris Iskandar, Joko Santoso, Uju Uju, Ellya Sinurat</authors>
    <abstract>Komposisi kimia dan asam amino C. lentillifera dipengaruhi oleh beberapa faktor eksternal, di antaranya suhu, nutrien, kualitas air, musim, geografi, cuaca, dan lingkungan atau tempat tumbuh. C. lentillifera seperti makroalga lainnya, memiliki kemampuan untuk mengakumulasi nutrien bahkan senyawa antropogenik dari lingkungan yang kemudian dimanfaatkan untuk aktivitas fisiologinya. Komposisi nutrisi rumput laut dari lingkungan yang berbeda menarik untuk dikaji. Tujuan dari penelitian adalah untuk mengevaluasi komposisi kimia dan asam amino C. lentillifera dari hasil budidaya dan mengestimasi kualitas proteinnya kemudian dibandingkan dengan C. lentillifera hasil alam. Budidaya C. lentillifera dilakukan pada wadah terkontrol selama 40 hari. Parameter yang dianalisis meliputi identifikasi morfologi, proksimat, profil asam amino menggunakan HPLC dan kualitas protein menggunakan pendekatan indeks asam amino esensial (EAAI) dan rasio efisiensi protein (P-PER). Hasil penelitian menunjukkan C. lentillifera budidaya dalam wadah terkontrol memiliki komposisi mineral yang lebih tinggi daripada C. lentillifera hasil alam, sedangkan kandungan protein, lemak, air, dan karbohirat pada C. lentillifera hasil budidaya lebih kecil dibandingkan C. lentillifera hasil alam. C. lentillifera hasil budidaya memiliki total kandungan asam amino (esensial dan non esensial) yang rendah dibandingkan hasil alam. Berdasarkan evaluasi kualitas protein, C. lentillifera hasil budidaya dalam wadah terkontrol dan hasil alam menghasilkan protein berkualitas sangat baik. Asam amino pembatas untuk C. lentillifera hasil budidaya dalam wadah terkontrol adalah triptofan sedangkan asam amino pembatas untuk C. lentillifera hasil alam adalah metionin dan sistein. AbstractThe chemical and amino acid composition of C. lentillifera is influenced by several external factors such as temperature, nutrients, water quality, season, geography, weather, and the environment or location where it grows. C. lentillifera, like other macroalgae, can accumulate nutrients and even anthropogenic compounds from environment and use them for their physiological activities. Therefore, the nutritional composition of seaweeds under different conditions is an interesting research topic. This study aimed to evaluate the chemical and amino acid composition of C. lentillifera from cultivated products, estimate the quality of the resulting protein, and compare it with that of C. lentillifera from wild-stock products. C. lentillifera was cultivated in controlled containers for 40 d. The parameters analyzed included identification of morphology, proximate amino acids using HPLC, and protein quality using the essential amino acid index (EAAI) and protein efficiency ratio (P-PER) approaches. The results of the research showed that cultivated C. lentillifera in controlled containers had a higher mineral composition than wild-stock C. lentillifera, while the protein, fat, water and carbohydrate content of cultivated C. lentillifera was lower than wild-stock C. lentillifera. C. lentillifera from cultivation has a lower total amino acid content (essential and non-essential) compared to wild-stock products. Based on protein quality evaluation, C. lentillifera cultivated in controlled containers and wild stock products produced very high-quality protein. The limiting amino acid for C. lentillifera cultivated in controlled containers is tryptophan, whereas the limiting amino acids for C. lentillifera from wild stock products are methionine and cysteine.</abstract>

    <abstract>Dry noodles, commonly produced from wheat flour, have been associated with health issues, including obesity, when consumed in excess. Moreover, reliance on imported wheat flour requires local alternatives to enhance its acceptability within the community. This study aimed to evaluate the physical characteristics of dry noodles incorporating a blend of wheat flour, sago flour, and seagrape flour (Caulerpa racemosa). The study involved experimental treatment with varying amounts of added seagrape flour (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 g). Additionally, the study evaluated the proximate composition of seagrape and sago flour was sourced from Sangihe Islands. The physical attributes analysed in the combined dry noodles included the moisture content, water absorption, cooking loss, and cooking time. Proximate analysis of seagrape flour revealed carbohydrate content of 47.83%, protein 19.78%, ash 17.83%, moisture 12.37%, and fat 2.19%. Sago flour had a proximate content of 87.45% carbohydrates, 11.7% moisture, 0.42% protein, 0.32% ash, and 0.11% fat. The moisture content of the combined dry noodles ranged from 6.83 to 7.83%, water absorption from 72.73 to 90.27%, cooking loss from 8.23 to 13.27%, and cooking time from 7.00 to 7.09 minutes. In conclusion, seagrape flour in the formulation influenced the water absorption and cooking loss of dry noodles prepared from wheat and sago flours. However, the combined dry noodles had no significant impact on the moisture content and cooking time.</abstract>

    <authors>Muhammad Farid Sudibyo, Joko Santoso, Desniar Desniar</authors>
    <abstract>Hydrolysis of polysaccharides can increase biological activity by changing the structure of polysaccharide functional groups and reducing molecular weight. Enzyme hydrolysis is an environmentally friendly hydrolysis method because it does not form toxic by-products. Lactobacillus plantarum can produce amylase and cellulase enzymes, which can be used to hydrolyze C. racemosa polysaccharides. This research aims to determine the best fermentation time and starter concentration in the C. racemosa polysaccharide hydrolysis process and the C. racemosa glucose concentration before and after fermentation. The research was divided into phases: phase I and II. The fermentation time in Phase I is six days, while in Phase II, it is 48 hours. The starter concentrations used are 0%, 5%, and 10%. The analysis showed that differences in starter concentration and fermentation time caused changes in the total values of LAB, TTA, pH, reducing sugar and glucose concentration. The best treatment was shown by adding 5% starter with a fermentation time of 24 hours.</abstract>

    <abstract>The marine environment provides a rich source of distinct creatures containing potentially revolutionary bioactive chemicals. One of these organisms is Caulerpa racemosa, a type of green algae known as green seaweed, seagrapes, or green caviar. This organism stands out because it has great promise for use in medicine, especially in the study of cancer. Through the utilization of computational modeling (in silico) and cellular laboratory experiments (in vitro), the chemical components included in the green seaweed C. racemosa were effectively analyzed, uncovering its capability to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study specifically emphasized blocking SRC, STAT3, PIK3CA, MAPK1, EGFR, and JAK1 using molecular docking and in vitro. These proteins play a crucial role in the EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Resistance pathway in NSCLC. The chemical Caulersin (C2) included in C. racemosa extract (CRE) has been identified as a potent and effective agent in fighting against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), both in silico and in vitro. CRE and C2 showed a level of inhibition similar to that of osimertinib (positive control/NSCLC drug).</abstract>

    <abstract>This research aims to determine the formula and level of panelists' preferences as well as the chemical quality of pineapple jam with the addition of lawi-lawi. The treatment in the research was the addition of lawi-lawi with concentrations of A (75%), B (50%) and C (25%). The organoleptic data obtained was processed using Kruskall Wallis analysis and chemical data using a Simple Completely Randomized Design. Further test results use Duncan's advanced test. The results of the research showed that the pineapple jam formula obtained was by adding different lawsi-lawi: A (75%), B (50%) and C (25%) with the other ingredients used being the same (pineapple 100g, sugar 65g and citric acid 0.2g). Panelists preferred pineapple jam with the addition of 75% lawi-lawi (formula B). Pineapple jam formula A (75% lawi-lawi), has chemical quality characteristics; sugar content 60.20%, viscosity 1875cp, dissolved solids 65.20% and calcium 1.04%. Formula B (50% lawi-lawi) has a sugar content of 57.70%, viscosity of 900cp, soluble solids of 65.61% and calcium of 1.02%. Formula C (25% lawi-lawi) has a sugar content of 51.68, a viscosity of 550cp, soluble solids of 67.13% and calcium of 0.94%. This study shows that pineapple jam with a 75% addition of lawi-lawi (formula A) is most preferred by panelists and has good chemical quality. Overall, the addition of lawi-lawi at various concentrations affects the organoleptic and chemical characteristics of pineapple jam, with the best results at a 75% concentration.</abstract>

    <abstract>The deficiency in the worldwide protein provision from marine capture fisheries has led the Malaysian government to reevaluate its aquaculture approach, prioritising three commodities: seaweed, fish, and marine shrimp. However, comprehensive documentation of the performance of the Malaysian aquaculture sector, particularly in seaweed production, is lacking.Caulerpa(Chlorophyta), a seaweed genus abundantly available in Malaysia, holds the potential to emerge as a primary alternative food source in the future. This paper offers an overview ofCaulerpaaquaculture, specifically focusing onC. lentilliferaandC. racemosa, covering aspects such as taxonomy, phytomorphology, geographical distribution and habitat, cultivation system, chemical composition, pharmacological properties, and future prospects for sustainable aquaculture. Although the cultivation system has been implemented on a small scale in various districts in Malaysia, it is anticipated to escalate production and productivity due to the substantial demand forCaulerpaspp. both domestically and globally. The cultivation ofCaulerpaspp. in Malaysia, in alignment with the National Agrofood Policy 2021–2030 (NAP 2.0), signals a trajectory toward enhancing the nation's food security in aquaculture and meeting the economic requirements for seaweed production.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of dietary seaweed Caulerpa racemosa on growth, biochemical, non-specific immunity, and disease resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Cirrhinus mrigala</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Cholaraj Ragunath, Venkatachalam Ramasubramanian</authors>
    <abstract>Abstract                    Background                   The green seaweed  Caulerpa racemosa  possesses highly potential elements in animal forages and human use since ancient times. The current study was designed to investigate the antioxidants, phytochemical properties of  C. racemosa , as well as their effects on growth parameters, biochemical components, non-specific immunological parameters, and disease resistance to  P. aeruginosa  in  Cirrhinus mrigala . The experimental group, divided into five groups as T1–T5. T2–T5, was given  C. racemosa  extract at concentrations of 0.5%, 2.5%, 4.5%, &amp;amp; 6.5% supplemented with basal diets. T1's group food is devoid of extract and acts as a control, and the trial lasted forty-five days.                                    Results                    C. racemosa  exhibited dose-dependent antioxidant activity. The highest levels of DPPH (61.21%), ABTS (70.55%), and H 2 O 2  (66.55%) scavenging activities were obtained at 100 µg/ml 100 μg/ml. GC–MS analysis revealed phytoconstituents in the crude extract, such as palmitolinoleic acid, butanoic acid, arachidonate, linoleic acid, vaccenic acid, octadecenoic acid, trans-phytol, and eicosanoids. Among these different concentrations, 4.5% C. racemosa supplemented diet produced a significantly higher growth metrics of  C. mrigala’s  (WG, SGR, FCR), biochemical constituents, when compared to other concentrations. In a post-challenge trial, 4.5%  C. racemosa  extract meals increased  C. mrigala  SOD, CAT, non-specific immune response (lysozyme, NBT, phagocytic activity), and haematological (RBC, WBC, HCT &amp;amp; Hb) parameters when compared to other experiments.                                    Conclusions                   The findings revealed that 4.5% of  C. racemosa  may be supplied in the diet of  C. mrigala  to regulate better survival growth performance and haematological parameters.</abstract>

    <title>Assessment of Anti-Prostate Cancer Activity among Four Seaweeds, with Focus on Caulerpa lentillifera J.Agardh</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Guan-James Wu, Pei-Wen Hsiao</authors>
    <abstract>In response to a global shift towards health-conscious and environmentally sustainable food choices, seaweed has emerged as a focus for researchers due to its large-scale cultivation potential and the development of bioactive substances. This research explores the potential anticancer properties of seaweed extracts, focusing on analyzing the impact of four common edible seaweeds in Taiwan on prostate cancer (PCa) cells’ activity. The study used bioassay-guided fractionation to extract Cl80 from various seaweeds with androgen receptor (AR)-inhibitory activity. Cl80 demonstrated effective suppression of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced AR activity in 103E cells and attenuated the growth and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) protein expression in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Additionally, Cl80 exhibited differential effects on various PCa cell lines. Concentrations above 5 μg/mL significantly inhibited LNCaP cell proliferation, while 22Rv1 cells were more resistant to Cl80. PC-3 cell proliferation was inhibited at 5 μg/mL but not completely at 50 μg/mL. A clonogenic assay showed that at a concentration of 0.5 μg/mL, the colony formation in LNCaP and PC-3 cells was significantly reduced, with a dose-dependent effect. Cl80 induced apoptosis in all PCa cell types, especially in LNCaP cells, with increased apoptotic cells observed at higher concentrations. Cl80 also decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in a dose-dependent manner in all PCa cell lines. Furthermore, Cl80 suppressed the migration ability of PCa cells, with significant reductions observed in LNCaP, 22Rv1, and PC-3 cells at various concentrations. These compelling findings highlight the promising therapeutic potential of C. lentillifera J.Agardh and its isolated compound Cl80 in the treatment of PCa.</abstract>

    <authors>D Sulistiawati, Hafsah, A P Damayanti, A Rizal</authors>
    <abstract>Abstract                  This study aims to determine the effect of dietary sea grapes (Caulerpa sp.) on laying hen performance and egg quality. Forty strain Lohmann layers of 56 weeks of age were randomly divided into five treatments. Each treatment consisted of four replicates, and each replicate used two chickens. The dietary treatments were assigned to the control group (T0 0% Caulerpa sp., T1 0.5% Caulerpa sp., T2 1% Caulerpa sp., T3 1.5% Caulerpa sp., and T4 2% Caulerpa sp.). The treatment diets were comprised of iso energy (2,900 ME kcal/kg) and iso protein (18%). Feed and drinking water were available ad libitum. Twenty hundred eggs were collected to measure the external and internal egg quality. The data collected included egg production (laying rate), egg mass, feed intake, feed conversion ratio (FCR), external egg quality (weight eggs, shell thickness), and internal egg quality (eggshell component, albumen height, yolk height, yolk color, and yolk antioxidant). A complete experiment was studied in four weeks. After analyzing the data statistically using a one-way ANOVA, we proceeded with the Tukey test to further examine the results. The results showed that dietary Caulerpa sp. until the 2% level did not affect laying hen performance or egg quality; however, 1.5% Caulerpa sp. reduced FCR and had high antioxidant activity.</abstract>

    <title>Transcriptome and functional analyses of phenotypic plasticity in sea grape &lt;i&gt;Caulerpa okamurae&lt;/i&gt;</title>

    <abstract>Abstract   Caulerpa  is a marine green macroalga distinguished by a large single cell with multiple nuclei. It also exhibits remarkable morphological intraspecies variations, in response to diverse environmental types. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotypic plasticity remain poorly understood. In this work, we compare the transcriptomes of  Caulerpa okamurae  Weber Bosse, 1897 displaying altered phenotypes of cultivation and natural phenotypes and investigate significantly regulated genes and their biological functions using differential expression analyses. We observe light‐harvesting complex upregulation and cellular framework stability downregulation in altered phenotypes compared to the natural phenotypes. Intertidal macrophytes reduce light capture to avoid photodamage and regulate their morphology to protect against wave damage. In contrast, the lower light conditions and the cultivation environment augment light capture and increase a morphology prioritizing light trapping. Moreover, the addition of simulated wave‐sweeping stimuli induces a return to the natural morphology under high‐light conditions, showing how mechanical stress affects morphological organization in  C .  okamurae . We provide detailed gene expression patterns in  C. okamurae  under varying light intensities and water conditions, suggesting a distinct influence on its morphological traits.</abstract>

    <abstract>Caulerpa lentillifera has ingredients that are beneficial for health, such as anti-cancer, antioxidant, anti-diabetic, and immunostimulatory effects. This study was aimed to determine the content of phytochemical compounds and the LD50 acute toxicity dose of C. lentillifera infusion extracts on mice for their utilization as food or medicine. The phytochemical screening was done with a qualitative method. Twenty-five mice have been used for the acute toxicity test and divided into five groups of treatment (Control; 375 mg/kg BW; 750 mg/kg BW; 1.500 mg/kg BW; 3.000 mg/kg BW C. lentillifera infusion extracts orally). Symptoms of toxicity and mortality were observed 24 hours after treatment, and body weight was observed for seven days. The phytochemical screening result showed that the C. lentillifera infusion extracts contained alkaloids, saponins, and tannins. Acute toxicity tests showed no mortality in all treatment groups. Thus, the LD50 value could not be obtained and was classified as non-toxic.</abstract>

    <title>Taxonomic Insights into Caulerpa (Bryopsidales, Chlorophyta) Species in French Polynesia: Confirmation of 13 Species and Reinstatement of C. pickeringii Harvey &amp;amp; Bailey</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Laura Lagourgue, Thomas Sauvage, Mayalen Zubia, Stefano G. A. Draisma, Christophe Vieira, Aschwin Engelen, Claude E. Payri</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpa J.V. Lamouroux is a genus of green macroalgae belonging to the family Caulerpaceae in the order Bryopsidales. The genus comprises 104 currently accepted species, of which 51 have been recorded from Pacific Islands. Among these islands, French Polynesia is found in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean and includes five archipelagos (i.e., the Austral, Gambier, Marquesas, Society, and Tuamotu Islands) where seaweed inventories have reported a total of 16 Caulerpa species so far based on morphology. Here, based on a sampling covering the five archipelagos of French Polynesia, we attempt to (i) verify the taxonomy of Caulerpa species present in these regions based on phylogeny, (ii) describe in more detail the specific diversity between the five archipelagos, and (iii) provide a morphological identification tool for these species. We successfully obtained 134 new tufA sequences for phylogenetic analyses, which corresponded to 13 species. We propose to resurrect C. pickeringii Harvey &amp;amp; Bailey for representatives of C. webbiana var. pickeringii and classify it in the Caulerpa subgenus Araucarioideae. We also transfer C. seuratii to C. pickeringii based on genetic results. A new morphological identification key is provided as well as an updated distribution of Caulerpa species across French Polynesia.</abstract>

    <abstract>Abstract                    Background                   β-1,3-Xylooligosaccharides (XOS-3) extracted from  Caulerpa lentillifera  have shown potential antioxidative and anti-tumor properties, but research on their biological activities, particularly their anti-osteoarthritis effects, is still in early stages.                                    Results                   XOS-3 were produced by eco-friendly enzymatic hydrolysis, displaying a semi-crystalline structure with predominant xylose, xylobiose, xylotriose, and xylotetraose components which were confirmed by IC, SEM, FT-IR, and XRD analysis. Compared with β-1,4-xylooligosaccharides, XOS-3 had stronger antioxidant properties, and the scavenging rate of O 2  •−  and DPPH •  radicals was 82.31% and 58.44% at 2.0 mg/mL respectively. In vitro studies, XOS-3 significantly improved cell viability in IL-1β-induced rat chondrocytes from 43.41 to 73.5% at 100 μg/mL, demonstrating anti-inflammatory and cartilage-protective effects by modulating MMP13 and COL2A1 expression.                                    Conclusions                   The study displayed the potential antioxidative and anti-osteoarthritis effects of XOS-3, offering new visuals for the development of marine polysaccharides in the treatment of osteoarthritis.

    <abstract>Abstract                  Sea grapes ( Caulerpa lentillifera ) have potential economic value and need to be conserved in their natural environment. The growth and distribution of  C. lentillifera  depend on physical (such as substrate) and chemical (nutrient) factors of the marine environment. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of different concentrations of liquid organic fertilizers on the growth of  C. lentillifera  in a closed culture system. This research was done from April to June 2022. The culture of  C. lentillifera  was done under a closed culture system using a fiber cage (50 x 50 x 60 cm) inside a (plastic) greenhouse. The experimental design used a complete randomized design of 5 treatments with three replications each. Variables observed during this study were length, weight, and sea grape ramuli quantity. The data was analyzed by using one-way ANOVA. The results show that adding liquid organic fertilizer with different concentrations has an impact on the sea grape weight (F                        value                      3.764 &amp;gt; F                        tab                      3.48) and an increase in the quantity of sea grape ramuli (F                        value                      3.608 &amp;gt; F                        tab                     3.48). The optimum concentration of liquid organic fertilizer for the growth of sea grapes was 20 ml.L −1 . The culture of  C. lentillifera  can be done in a closed system and give good results in its growth. Further study still needs to be done by applying different treatments such as salinity and temperature in order to get exactly good conditions for  C. lentillifera  to grow in culture conditions and give a good quality that can be consumed and a good economic value.</abstract>

Obesity is correlated with the consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) and monosodium glutamate (MSG). Although the effect of MSG or HFD on inflammation has been established, lack of information about the effects of both combination on simultaneous systemic and brain inflammation that can be evaluated from cortisol serum and brain resistin level respectively. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the effects of combining HFD and MSG on brain resistin, serum cortisol, lipid profiles, visceral weight, and body weight gain. Methods: Sixteen adult female rats were randomized into 4 groups consist of standard diet; HFD+MSG 0.05 mg/gBW, HFD+MSG 0.2 mg/gBW and HFD+MSG 0.35 mg/gBW. Lipid profiles were measured using automatic biochemical analyzer. Brain resistin and serum cortisol level were determined using enzyme-linked immunoassay. Results: The groups of HFD+MSG significantly have higher level of brain resistin (p&lt;0.003), serum cortisol (p&lt;0.01), total cholesterol (p&lt;0.003) and visceral fat weight (p&lt;0.05) than control group. Conclusion: The combination of HFD, and MSG generates obesity that led to systemic-brain alteration on inflammation. Further study is necessary to evaluate further the functional impact of both combinations on behavioral profiles.</abstract>

    <title>Proximate Composition and Heavy Metal Content of Edible Seaweed from Kappaphycus alvarezii and Caulerpa cf. macrodisca ecad corynephora</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Kingpu O. Ajik, Albaris Tahıluddın</authors>
    <abstract>Edible seaweeds, such as Kappaphycus and Caulerpa genera, have been popularly consumed for centuries by the local people in the Tawi-Tawi, Philippines. This study examined the proximate composition and heavy metal contents of two edible seaweeds, namely Kappaphycus alvarezii (KA) (Rhodophyta) and Caulerpa cf. macrodisca ecad corynephora (CMC) (Chlorophyta), which are readily available in the public market of Bongao, Tawi-Tawi, Philippines. The results revealed significant differences in their proximate compositions. The moisture content was remarkably higher in KA (16.96±0.02 g.100-1g) than that of CMC (10.49±0.08 g.100-1g). CMC contained significantly more crude protein (7.14±0.80 g.100-1g) than KA (2.73±0.40 g.100-1g). The carbohydrate content of KA (44.82±0.34 g.100-1g) was significantly higher than that of CMC (38.09±0.71 g.100-1g). The ash content was notably greater in CMC (44.00±0.66 g.100-1g) than in KA (34.91±0.39 g.100-1g). The total fat content was substantially higher (p≤0.05) in KA (0.60±0.30 g.100-1g) than in CMC (0.28±0.01 g.100-1g). The heavy metal contents (mg.kg-1) followed the order of K &amp;amp;gt; Zn &amp;amp;gt; Fe &amp;amp;gt; Pb &amp;amp;gt; Cu &amp;amp;gt; Mn &amp;amp;gt; Cd for KA and Zn &amp;amp;gt; Mn &amp;amp;gt; Pb &amp;amp;gt; K &amp;amp;gt; Fe &amp;amp;gt; Cu &amp;amp;gt; Cd for CMC. Fe, K, Cu, and Cd were significantly higher in KA than in CMC, while Zn, Mn, and Pb were remarkably higher in CMC than in KA. However, all these heavy metals were found to be within safe limits of WHO, the US (EPA and FDA), and EMA. These findings underscore the importance of considering these factors in seaweed consumption, affirming their enduring significance in human diets.</abstract>

    <abstract>Caulerpa lentillifera is known to have an antibacterial benefit based on various research findings. The study aims to analyze the potential of the Caulerpa lentillifera water extract in the bacterial barrier power isolated from the lele infected wound disease. The methods carried out included extracting Caulerpa lentillifera water extract. The study was conducted using an experimental method with a Complete Random Scheme (RAL) consisting of control, 50 mg/l and 100 mg/ l on each extract. The results showed that the water extract of Caulerpa lentillifera showed significant increases in the barrier strength at doses of 50 mg / l and 100mg/l with diameters of 7.8 mm and 8.4 mm respectively in bacteria isolated from the disease-affected fish wounds. On the other hand, on the result of the bacterial barrier that is isolated from the living media, the lele obtains a low barrier. This is due to the bioactive activity of the antibacterial water extract Cauleroa lentillifera specific to bacteria. It can be concluded that Caulerpa lentillifera is also capable of inhibiting the growth of the bacteria causing the lily's wound</abstract>

    <abstract>Inflammation and collagen-degrading enzymes’ overexpression promote collagen decomposition, which affects the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix. The polysaccharide and peptide extracts of the green alga Caulerpa microphysa (C. microphysa) have been proven to have anti-inflammatory, wound healing, and antioxidant effects in vivo and in vitro. However, the biological properties of the non-water-soluble components of C. microphysa are still unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated the higher effective anti-inflammatory functions of C. microphysa ethyl acetate (EA) extract than water extract up to 16–30% in LPS-induced HaCaT cells, including reducing the production of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Furthermore, the excellent collagen homeostasis effects from C. microphysa were proven by suppressing the matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) secretion, enhancing type 1 procollagen and collagen expressions dose-dependently in WS1 cells. Moreover, using UHPLC-QTOF-MS analysis, four terpenoids, siphonaxanthin, caulerpenyne, caulerpal A, and caulerpal B, were identified and may be involved in the superior collagen homeostasis and anti-inflammatory effects of the C. microphysa EA extract.</abstract>

    <abstract>Ranowangko II beach is famous for its beautiful beaches and is a natural habitat for macroalgae, including Caulerpa racemosa and Sargassum polycystum. Despite its great potential and abundance, information about the nutritional content of both types of algae, especially in the Ranowangko II beach area, is still limited. This study aimed to determine the nutritional content (water content, ash content, protein, lipid, crude fiber, carbohydrate) of green algae Caulerpa racemosa and brown algae Sargassum polycystum in Ranowangko II beach. The type of research used is descriptive quantitative to determine the proximate nutrient content of two types of algae tested by proximate analysis in the laboratory. Based on the study results, there were variations in the nutritional content of the two types of algae tested. Green algae Caulerpa racemosa has a moisture content of 71.29%, ash content of 6.90%, protein of 2.78%, fat of 1.34%, crude fiber of 3.53%, and carbohydrates of 17.69%. Brown algae Sargassum polycystum has a water content of 83.23%, ash content of 1.82%, protein of 9.93%, fat of 1.72%, crude fiber of 11.18%, and carbohydrates of 3.30%. The conclusion obtained after conducting this research is that Caulerpa racemosa (green algae) and Sargassum polycystum (brown algae) have different nutritional content.</abstract>

    <title>Physiological Impacts of CO2-Induced Acidification and UVR on Invasive Alga Caulerpa racemosa</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Gamze Yildiz</authors>
    <abstract>Anthropogenically increasing atmospheric CO2causes changes in the carbon chemistry of seawater. With these changes, the HCO3−and CO2concentration of seawater increases, while the pH decreases. CO2-induced ocean acidification by interacting with ultraviolet radiation (UVR) affects the metabolic pathways of seaweeds such as photosynthesis, growth, and nutrient uptake in a species-specific manner. This study was designed to determine the future ecological success ofCaulerpa racemosa, an invasive species in the Mediterranean. In laboratory culture,C. racemosawas exposed to CO2-induced low pH (pH: 7.7) with or without UVR (UVA: 1.2 W m−2; UVB: 0.55 W m−2) and its physiological responses were investigated. Maximum quantum yield of photosystem-II (Fv/Fm) and light utilization efficiency (α) ofC. racemosawas negatively affected by low pH and UVR. However, low pH increased the rETRmax(maximum relative electron transfer rate) ofC. racemosa. This increased rETRmaxindicated that the photosynthesis ofC. racemosawas not photosynthetically saturated at the ambient inorganic carbon pool. This could be an advantage in competing with other species in the predicted future ocean acidification. The combined effect of low pH and UVR affected the rETRmaxofC. racemosain different ways along with the incubation time. The synergistic effect observed in the first two weeks turned into an antagonistic effect in the last two weeks. The data obtained from this study suggest that incubation time is the most effective factor in the response ofC. racemosato CO2-induced low pH and moderate-level UVR. In addition, our results support the hypothesis thatC. racemosamay be one of the species that will benefit from CO2-induced ocean acidification.</abstract>

    <title>The potential Two Types of Green Macroalgae (Caulerpa racemose and Caulerpa lentillifera) as a Natural Food Preservative from Jepara beach, Indonesia</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Gunawan Widi Santosa, Ali Djunaedi, AB Susanto, Delianis Pringgenies, Dafit Ariyanto, Aris Kabul Pranoton</authors>
    <abstract>Green macroalgae, known locally as Latoh, is one of the green seaweeds consumed by the local community in Jepara and is beneficial for health. This study explores the potential of secondary metabolites from seaweed and its symbiotic bacteria as natural food preservatives and antibacterials. Seaweed samples were collected from the seagrass ecosystem of Panjang Island, Jepara, Indonesia. Subsequently, the samples were subjected to scanning electron microscopy analysis, proximate analysis, phytochemical analysis, thin layer chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography for amino acid analysis. A sample was subjected to a multistage extraction process using n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol (1:5 w/v), each for 24 h. Symbiotic bacteria from seaweed were isolated, and enzymatic (proteolytic, amylolytic, and cellulolytic) and antibacterial testing against pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was conducted using the disc diffusion method. The selected bacteria were subjected to molecular identification. The research showed that Caulerpa lentillifera had an ash content of 3.24 %, protein content of 0.57 %, and fat content of 0.337 %. Phytochemical analysis shows that the sample contains flavonoids, steroids, and alkaloids. HPLC analysis reveals that Caulerpa lentillifera has the highest content of aspartic acid (relative area: 11.90 %), glutamic acid (relative area: 13.43 %), and alanine (relative area: 9.03 %). Caulerpa racemosa sample shows the highest detector response for glutamic acid (relative area: 12.19%), aspartic acid (relative area: 11.10 %), and alanine (relative area: 9.63 %). The results indicate that 14 bacterial isolates were successfully isolated, with 6 isolates from Caulerpa lentillifera and 8 isolates from Caulerpa racemosa, all exhibiting enzymatic and antibacterial abilities. The research results concluded that the Latoh seaweed species Caulerpa lentillifera and Caulerpa racemosa and their symbiotic bacteria have the potential to be used as food preservatives.

    <abstract>This study investigated six wall composition material substitutes employed in constructing Egypt's Ibny Baitak Project for their potential environmental impact. Clay brick (20 cm ), cement brick (20 cm ), and autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) (20 𝑐𝑚 ) blocks were the four materials evaluated. Each wall material is reinforced with (4 cm extruded polystyrene (XPS) insulation in the fourth, fifth, and sixth scenarios. The study used a life cycle assessment (LCA) technique to assess the environmental impact of these products from cradle to gate, including raw material extraction, processing, and transportation. The outcomes showed that the environmental effects of the four materials varied greatly regarding the three impact categories of potential global warming, non-renewable energy use, and respiratory pollution. Regarding the midpoint result, the AAC ranked second by 1.49 𝑝𝑡 , followed by the cement bricks by 2.25 pt , with the clay brick recording the lowest environmental effect. The environmental impacts in the three final scenarios increased by 1.24 pt , 1.86 𝑝𝑡 , and 2.55 𝑝𝑡 , and an incremental rate of 13% when the XPS was added to the three wall types. The 20 𝑐𝑚 cement brick recorded the highest value, 8.40K KG Co 2 e, and the 4 cm XPS + 20 𝑐𝑚 cement brick composition recorded the lowest value, 1.97K KG Co 2 e. When considering the endpoint results, the cement brick recorded the highest values by 8.40K 𝐾𝐺 𝐶𝑜 2 e, which show climate change has the most significant impacts. Regarding the resource's depletion impact, cement bricks recorded the highest values with 138.42K Mj primay . The study's findings provide important details regarding the environmental effects of composition wall materials. They can influence decisions made in the construction sector, favoring greener building practices. © 2024 Published by Faculty of Engineering – Sohag University.

    <title>Proximate Composition, Phytochemical Analysis and Toxicity Assessment of Extracts of Caulerpa lentillifera using Autoclave- and Microwave-Assisted Extractions</title>
    <year>2024</year>

    <abstract>Caulerpa lentilliferais a marine alga widely cultured and consumed in Asia and Oceania.  Emerging green techniques are currently popular for phytochemical extraction. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the proximate compositions, phytochemicals, and antioxidant properties of the C. lentilliferaextracts using autoclave-assisted and microwave-assisted extraction methods (A-CLE and M-CLE, respectively). The toxicity of extracts was tested against human normal colon cells and freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna. We found that crude lipid, ash and moisture contents in A-CLE were lower than those in M-CLE, while crude protein and crude carbohydrate were higher in A-CLE. Total flavonoid content in A-CLE (1.474 ± 0.046 mg QE g-1 extract) was higher than that in M-CLE (1.179 ± 0.054 mg QE g-1 extract). There was no difference in total phenolic contents, triterpenoid contents and antioxidant activities between the extracts. The IC50 of A-CLE (12,260 ± 197 µg mL-1) was higher than that of M-CLE (10,950 ± 169 µg mL-1). In the acute toxicity test, the LC50 of A-CLE against D. magna (7.50 ± 0.28 g L-1) was lower than LC50 of M-CLE (8.76 ± 0.26 g L-1). This study suggest that autoclave-assisted and microwave-assisted extractions are effective green methods of extracting C. lentillifera. This study will be useful for further studies of C. lentillifera extracts to improve human and animal health.</abstract>

    <abstract>Caulerpa lentillifera (sea grapes) stands out for its nutritional profile and associated health advantages. Seaweeds, including sea grapes, exhibit diverse chemical compositions that are influenced by environmental conditions. This study aimed to compare the chemical composition, metabolite content, antioxidant activity and α-glucosidase inhibition of sea grapes collected at different sites (Phetchaburi and Trang) and at different times during the month of January, April, and July 2022. Both collection times and sites have influenced all assessed parameters. The sea grapes collected from Trang had a significantly higher amount of metabolite, antioxidant activity and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity than those from Phetchaburi at p &amp;lt; 0.001. The highest amount of phenolic compound (93.76 ± 2.39 mg GAE/g extract) and reducing power (EC50 = 25.86 ± 0.20 mg/mL) occurred in sea grapes in April month, while those collected in January and April had high DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging (EC50 &amp;lt; 7.50 mg/mL). The highest inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase (EC50 = 19.27 ± 0.40 mg/mL) was found in the sea grapes collected in January. The LC-QTOF MS/MS result of sea grape extract indicated similar compounds in amino acids, fatty acids, lipids, nucleic acids, carboxylic acids, cyanogenic glucosides, steroids, terpenoids and vitamins. The disparity in phenolic profiles between Phetchaburi (9) and Trang (14) sea grapes was related to higher phenolic compound and flavonoid contents, coupled with antioxidant properties in Trang. These findings supported the possible use of sea grapes from Trang as a reservoir of bioactive compounds. HIGHLIGHTS  Chemical profile and content, antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibition of sea grapes was analyzed Collection times and sites affected all measured parameters of sea grapes extract Sea grapes from Trang exhibited higher all measured parameters than Phetchaburi A novel chemical profiling of sea grapes was displayed via LC-QTOF MS/MS analysis  GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT</abstract>

    <title>Use of Biomass from Beached Algae of the Genus Caulerpa to Obtain the Alkaloid Caulerpin</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Tiago Tosta Alves Cruz, Sabrina Teixeira Martinez</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpin is an alkaloid with various biological activities, such as antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, and antitumoral. This natural product is the majority in algae of the genus Caulerpa, which are found fixed to rocks on the seabed and beached to the sands. The objective of the research was to evaluate the possibility of using the biomass of these marginalized algae to obtain the alkaloid. Using ultrasound extraction and analysis by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, the results showed that it was possible to identify caulerpin in the beached algae. Furthermore, the alkaloid showed good resistance to photodegradation since caulerpin remained practically unchanged after 7 days of exposure to sunlight.</abstract>

    <abstract>Caulerpa macrodiscaandCaulerpa lentillifera,green macroalgae consumed as fresh salads in Malaysian communities esteemed for their robust nutritional profile, were investigated for their viability in dried seaweed sheet production. This study comprehensively analyzed the proximate composition and amino acid content of both species before incorporating them into dried seaweed sheet formulations. An organoleptic test, involving 50 diverse panellists, evaluated characteristics such as appearance, aroma, texture, taste, colour, and overall satisfaction. Three formulations, denoted as sample A (50%C. lentilliferaand 50%C. macrodisca), sample B (100%C. lentillifera), and sample C (100%C. macrodisca), were created, and compared with a commercially available dried seaweed sheet (Sample D). The proximate analysis revealed thatC. lentilliferacontained 12.47±0.06% moisture, 39.18±0.29% ash, 1.76±0.09% crude lipid, 11.35±0.24% crude protein, 23.99±0.95% crude fiber, and 35.24±0.59% carbohydrate, whileC. macrodiscaexhibited 8.99±0.25% moisture, 34.14±1.65% ash, 0.78±0.09% crude lipid, 21.51±0.44% crude protein, 19.70±0.82% crude fiber, and 34.57±2.12% carbohydrate. Amino acid analysis identified 16 amino acids, with phenylalanine being the highest for both species (C. lentillifera: 16.54±1.41 mg g-1,C. macrodisca: 20.96±0.27 mg g-1). The organoleptic test indicated that sample A achieved the highest overall satisfaction and texture scores, whereas sample C excelled in taste characteristics. Sample B received the lowest scores across all attributes. Consequently, this study suggests that the dried seaweed sheet formulated with a combination of both species (sample A) is favoured by most panellists, demonstrating its potential for commercialization as a wholesome and appealing snack.</abstract>

This study was experimental, using a factorial Completely Randomized Design (CRD) consisting of 2 factors, namely fertilizer (P) and depth (K). The fertilizers consisted of NPK (P1) and sap (P2), and the depths (K) consisted of 5 cm (K1), 10 cm (K2), and 15 cm (K3). Each treatment was repeated 3 times, so we had 18 combined treatments. The study was done at the Cultivation Laboratory of the National Innovation Research Agency (BRIN), Lombok, Indonesia. Research procedures included preparing material and tools, rearing C. racemosa, and harvesting C. racemosa. Research parameters included final weight, final length, specific decline rate, and survival rate. Data were analyzed using ANOVA. The results showed that the interaction of different fertilizers and depths affected the final weight, specific decline rate, and survival rate of C. racemosa. Meanwhile, the final length of C. racemosa was only influenced by different fertilizers. The best treatment happened in the interaction of NPK fertilizer and a depth of 15 cm, which gave a survival rate of 89%, a final weight of 88.66 g, and a specific decline rate of -10.67%/day</abstract>

    <abstract>This study evaluated the physicochemical properties of toothpaste from combined  Caulerpa racemosa  and  Thunnus  fish bone (Toothpaste  Caulerpa  and  Thunnus  or TCT) and its antibacterial activity towards the colonization of selected cariogenic and periodontal bacterias. Four forms of toothpaste which contained  C. racemosa  extract and calcium carbonate or bone isolates of tuna and control (F1 (1.5:45); F2 (3:45); F3 (4.5:45); F4 (0:45)) were compared and analyzed for antioxidant activity (DPPH assay), organoleptic (sensory), homogeneity, viscosity, pH, and foamability. Antibacterial activity tests were conducted on  Streptococcus mutans ,  Staphylococcus aureus , and  Porphyromonas gingivalis . The antioxidant activity of the group’s (F1, F2, F3, F4) p=0.0001 differed considerably (CI 95%). F3 was the most antioxidant-active formula, with 27.46 ± 3.09%. F3 also had good sensory tests, adequate homogeneity, optimal pH 7.64 ± 0.68, an increased viscosity level of 443.07 ± 0.12, and the least foam formations of 19.28 ± 0.07, all of which are significantly different (p&amp;amp;lt;0.05) from other variations of TCT formulas. Interestingly, F3 has greater inhibition against the activity of selected bacterias. In conclusion, formula 3 (F3) is a recommended toothpaste, made from combined  C. racemosa  and  Thunnus  fish bone, and has promising physicochemical and antibacterial properties. A further clinical study is urgently needed.</abstract>

    <title>The Invasion of Caulerpa cylindracea Sonder 1845 in the Calabria Coastal Seas</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Nicola Cantasano, Vincenzo Di Martino, Gaetano Pellicone</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpa cylindracea, Indo-Pacific and thermophilic macroalgal species, have spread in Italian coastal waters, especially in the western Mediterranean Sea. Also, along the Calabria coastline, this Invasive Alien Species (IAS) was able to colonize most of the western and eastern seasides of the region. This research was conducted between 1999 and 2021 through a detailed cost-effective citizen science program. The novelty of this research was to determine the overall distribution of Caulerpa cylindracea along Calabria seawaters from the Tyrrhenian to the Ionian coasts. The results of the monitoring survey highlighted the presence of Caulerpa cylindracea in 45 collecting stations throughout the Calabrian coastline. This regional assessment showed the extensive adaptability of the species to different environmental conditions: from exposed to sheltered sites, in shaded and sunny coastal areas and also throughout pristine and polluted waters. The rapid and increasing spread of the species could affect the structure of Mediterranean biota or, otherwise, could lead in time to new ecological niches. As highlighted in the most recent literature, it is necessary to update monitoring and mapping plans for the protection of marine biodiversity through close coordination between scientists, citizens and policy makers, all engaged to ensure effective management of invasive processes.</abstract>

    <abstract>Breast cancer is a neoplasm that is increasing globally based on its prevalence. Caulerpa racemosa is a type of sea grape that has anti-cancer activity based on previous studies. We aim to determine the anti-cancer activity of C. racemosa extract on Michigan cancer foundation-7 (MCF-7) breast cancer cells through the mechanism of apoptosis by observing cell viability and caspase-3 expression, also as an anti-metastatic agent on expression of Snail and Vimentin. A true experimental study was carried out using a randomized post-test-only control group design. MCF-7 cells were used as subjects with the intervention of C. racemosa extract at varying doses. Cell apoptotic was assessed by flow cytometry and cell viability test, while anti-metastatic activity was assessed by wound healing assay. Immunofluorescence staining was used to assess the expression level of caspase-3, Snail, and Vimentin. The results showed an increased activity of cell apoptosis, according to flow cytometry and cell viability tests. Furthermore, expression of caspase-3 was found to be significantly higher in the 400 g/ml dose group and MCF-7 cell migration inhibition by decreasing Snail and Vimentin protein expression. These results indicate a “novel mechanism” of C. racemosa in the MCF-7 model as an anti-cancer and anti-metastatic agent to inhibit breast cancer progression.</abstract>

    <abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate factors influencing post-graduate students' reading trends at university libraries in Islamabad as well as students' reading trends and their effects on academic achievement. Methodology: To accomplish the study's objectives, a quantitative research technique was used, and a survey based on a questionnaire was undertaken. For the purpose of gathering information from the respondents, a structured questionnaire was created. Data was gathered from the libraries of Islamabad-based HEC-recognized universities using a purposive sampling technique. The survey received 129 responses from users of the 16 libraries. Findings: This study reveals that respondents like to read electronic documents rather than paper-based materials. They read for multiple purposes, including academic assignments and course work, self-development, preparation for exams, and to improve their ability in spoken and written English language communication. The study also reveals that respondents get good grades due to reading, expressing themselves well in class, can make assignments easily, makes them feel proud, and reading newspapers increases their awareness level. The study also reveals that social networking sites like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and others, as well as time spent watching TV and playing video games, have a detrimental impact on the reading trends of postgraduate students in Islamabad. Originality: This is the first study of its kind conducted in the territory of Islamabad. Therefore, its findings can have a significant impact on the readers.  References Ahmad, M., Abawajy, J.

    <abstract>This research aimed to determine the effect of inorganic and organic fertilizers on the growth, survival rate, and chlorophyll-a content of  Caulerpa racemosa. C. racemosa  with an initial weight of 9.71±0.4 g was cultured for 28 days in three different culture media which were seawater without fertilizer (control), medium with inorganic hydroponic nutrient fertilizer (HN), and liquid organic fertilizer (LO). The cultured medium had significant differences in growth rate among treatments. The highest specific growth rate (SGR) of  C. racemosa  occurred when cultured in the HN medium with a rate of 2.70±0.02% per day, followed by the LO medium (2.07±0.03% per day) while the lowest SGR was in the control which was only 1.65±0.01% per day. In contrast, the three treatments media did not affect the survival rate of  C. racemosa . The chlorophyll-a content showed a positive correlation with growth rate, where the highest chlorophyll-a content was observed on the HN medium with a rate of 222.0±4.5 µg per gww), followed by the LO medium (208.6±6.6 µg per gww) and control (121.2±10.2 µg per gww). The HN medium could be used for land-based culturing of  C. racemosa  at the dosage of 1.5% (ml/L).</abstract>

    <abstract>Mosques, being public spaces, should be designed with the needs and preferences of the wider community in mind in order to facilitate spiritual practice and convenience. Through face-to-face interviews, mosque users have expressed a desire for a range of specific characteristics in their places of worship, further highlighting the importance of incorporating user input into the design process. The study aims to examine the design features of various mosques and assess their compliance with user preferences, with the broad goal of ensuring that mosques are capable of addressing their functional role. A field survey of six mosques was carried out. The findings show that mosque designers have not fully considered these preferences, resulting in a relative discrepancy between user preferences and actual mosque designs, which introduces concerns about the effectiveness and functionality of mosque spaces. Accordingly, the study recommends active community engagement in the design process from the early stages and emphasizes the need for retrofitting current mosques to address design deficiencies. In this context, the findings are useful for identifying areas for improvement for current and future mosques. They can also be utilized as a practical guideline for architects, designers, and other stakeholders involved in the mosque building process. © 2024 Published by Faculty of Engineering – Sohag University.

    <abstract>A simple idealized model to describe the hydraulic resistance caused by vegetation is compared to results from flow experiments conducted in natural waterways. Two field case studies are considered: fixed-point flow measurements in a Green River (case 1) and vessel-borne flow measurements along a cross-section with floodplains in the river Rhine (case 2). Analysis of the two cases shows that the simple flow model is consistent with measured flow velocities and the present vegetation characteristics, and may be used to predict a realistic Manning resistance coefficient. From flow measurements in the river floodplain (case 2) an estimate was made of the equivalent height of the drag dominated vegetation layer, as based on measured flow characteristics. The resulting height corresponds well with the observed height of vegetation in the floodplain. The expected depth-dependency of the associated Manning resistance coefficient for could not be detected due to lack of data for relatively shallow flows. Furthermore, it was shown that topographical variations in the floodplain may have an important impact on the flow field, which should not be mistaken as roughness effects.</abstract>

    <abstract>Co-culture of newly domesticated shrimp,  F. merguiensis , and green seaweed,  C. lentillifera , was conducted in six cement tanks to assess their impact on water quality and immunological response. Shrimp juveniles (14,3±0.3 mg) were stocked at a density of 50 shrimps/m 2  and co-cultured with  C. lentillifera  at two initial stocking rates: A (0.1 kg/m 2 ), B (0.2 kg/m 2 ), and C (without seaweed) as a control treatment. All treatments were replicated twice, and the trial lasted eight weeks. The results of the experiment demonstrated that co-culturing  F. merguiensis  with  C. lentillifera  not only improves water quality, primarily nitrogen (TAN, NO 2 , NO 3 ) and phospate (PO 4  - ) compounds, but also on immunological parameters (THC, DHC, PA, and PO activity) assessed. Shrimp production indicators improve significantly ( p&amp;lt;0.05 ) after seaweed treatments. Furthermore,  C. lentillifera  grows at a pace of more than 10% per day and is suggested for co-culture with shrimp at a density of 0.1 - 0.2 kg/m 2 .</abstract>

    <title>Effects of main ecological factors on the growth of marine green alga Caulerpa sertularioides using the response surface methodology</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Bingxin Huang, Yue Chu, Rongjuan Wang, Yixiao Wang, Lanping Ding</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpa sertularioidesis an invasive potential blooming green alga in China but it remains poorly studied. We studied the effects of ecological factors on its growth. Optimum conditions of ecological factors, i.e., irradiance, temperature, and salinity, for the growth of its fragments were determined in the response surface methodology (RSM). The specific growth rates (SGR) of the fragments were determined in single-factor experiment. The results show that the SGR ofC. sertularioidespeaked under the conditions of irradiance 37.5 µmol/(m2·s), temperature 25°C, and salinity 30. Meanwhile, using the Box-Behnken design, the conditions were further optimized and verified to be: irradiance 39.03 µmol/(m2·s), temperature 25.29°C, and salinity 30.06, under which the SGR reached 4.66%. The results provide new theoretical data and solutions for the cultivation, invasion prediction, and monitoring ofCaulerpaspecies in China and the world. The RSM method may have great potential applications in the environmental adaptation characteristics of new macroalgal cultivars, intensive orientation cultured germplasm, and environmental hazard analysis of cultivated species in the field.</abstract>

    <title>Hidden in plain sight: The invasive macroalga &lt;i&gt;Caulerpa prolifera&lt;/i&gt; evades detection by environmental DNA methods</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Tanner Waters, Kylie Langlois, Zachary Gold, Susanna Theroux, Robert A. Eagle</authors>
    <abstract>Abstract  Environmental managers need a rapid and cost‐effective monitoring tool for tracking the spread of invasive species, particularly at the onset of introduction. The macroalgae  Caulerpa prolifera  is considered an invasive species outside its native range, colonizing large patches of seafloor, reducing native species, and altering ecosystem functioning. Here, we developed a droplet digital PCR assay for detection of  C. prolifera  from environmental DNA seawater samples using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. While the assay itself was confirmed to be highly efficient, we discovered concentrations of  C. prolifera  eDNA were present below detectable levels in the water column surrounding an outbreak. To understand why, we conducted tank‐based experiments for two California invasive algae species,  Caulerpa prolifera  and  Sargassum horneri . The steady‐state eDNA concentration (eDNA copies/ gram of biomass detected) of  C. prolifera  was found to be two orders of magnitude lower than  S. horneri . A meta‐analysis of steady‐state concentrations reported in the literature showed a remarkable range from ~10 4 –10 11  (copies/g), revealing  C. prolifera  to have the lowest recorded steady‐state concentrations of eDNA of any known species. We attribute  C. prolifera's  low steady‐state eDNA concentration to its unique biology as a unicellular macroscopic algae which reduces the possible modes of eDNA release compared to similarly sized multicellular organisms. Critically our results demonstrate the potential limits of eDNA approaches, the influence of shedding rates in the reliability of species detections, and the vital importance of benchmarking and validating eDNA assays in both field and laboratory settings.</abstract>

    <title>Does Caulerpa prolifera with Its Bacterial Coating Represent a Promising Association for Seawater Phytoremediation of Diesel Hydrocarbons?</title>
    <year>2023</year>

    <abstract>Anthropic diesel-derived contamination of Mediterranean coastal waters is of great concern. Nature-based solutions such as phytoremediation are considered promising technologies to remove contaminants from marine environments. The aim of this work was to investigate the tolerance of the Mediterranean autochthonous seaweed Caulerpa prolifera (Forsskal) Lamouroux to diesel fuel and its hydrocarbon degradation potential. Changes in C. prolifera traits, including its associated bacterial community abundance and structure, were determined by fluorescence microscopy and next-generation sequencing techniques. Thalli of C. prolifera artificially exposed to increasing concentration of diesel fuel for 30 days and thalli collected from three natural sites with different levels of seawater diesel-derived hydrocarbons were analysed. Gas chromatography was applied to determine the seaweed hydrocarbon degradation potential. Overall, in controlled conditions the lower concentration of diesel (0.01%) did not affect C. prolifera survival and growth, whereas the higher concentration (1%) resulted in high mortality and blade damages. Similarly, only natural thalli, collected at the most polluted marine site (750 mg L−1), were damaged. A higher abundance of epiphytic bacteria, with a higher relative abundance of Vibrio bacteria, was positively correlated to the health status of the seaweed as well as to its diesel-degradation ability. In conclusion, C. prolifera tolerated and degraded moderate concentrations of seawater diesel-derived compounds, especially changing the abundance and community structure of its bacterial coating. The protection and exploitation of this autochthonous natural seaweed-bacteria symbiosis represents a useful strategy to mitigate the hydrocarbon contamination in moderate polluted Mediterranean costal environments.</abstract>

    <title>The Role of Cymodocea nodosa and Caulerpa prolifera Meadows as Nitrogen Sinks in Temperate Coastal Lagoons</title>
    <year>2023</year>

    <abstract>In coastal lagoons, marine benthic macrophyte meadows can be an important element in the resistance to eutrophication of the ecosystem, as they can function as temporary nitrogen sinks, limiting the availability of this nutrient for opportunistic organisms. The role of nitrogen sinks for two dominant macrophyte species of Mediterranean coastal lagoons, the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa and the seaweed Caulerpa prolifera, was analysed by two different approaches: (i) studying nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) uptake kinetics of aboveground tissues in a laboratory and (ii) estimating nitrogen stocks and demands of meadows under natural conditions. The studies were carried out in the coastal lagoon of the Mar Menor, which has been subjected to high anthropogenic nitrogen inputs for decades. While both macrophytes were efficient in exploiting NH4+ from the water column, only C. prolifera showed a high NO3- uptake capacity. Large N pools in the C. nodosa and C. prolifera meadows of the Mar Menor were detected, suggesting that these habitats may have the potential to be essential reservoirs for this nutrient. However, the major role of belowground tissues of the seagrasses in nitrogen accumulation may determine important differences between the two species in temporary N storage and sequestration. The data on N demands for the meadows of both macrophytes in the Mar Menor suggest an important contribution of these habitats in controlling the inputs of this nutrient into the lagoon. We conclude that C. nodosa and C. prolifera meadows can play a key role as a sink for dissolved inorganic nitrogen in temperate coastal lagoons, being an important mechanism of resistance to eutrophication.</abstract>

    <abstract>This study aimed to characterize the phytochemical composition, as well as antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of Tunisian &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Caulerpa prolifera&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; extracts using two different extraction methods. The total phenol, flavonoid, and condensed tannin contents of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;C. prolifera&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; extract obtained by successive extraction were lower (1.57 mg EAG/g, 1.45 mg C/g and 2 mg C/g, respectively) than those obtained by maceration (3.67 mg GAE/g, 1.93 mg C/g and 3.50 mg C/g, respectively). &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Caulerpa prolifera &amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;extracts obtained by the two extraction methods were inactive using DPPH activity. A decrease of antioxidant activity was found by using reducing power (IC&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;50&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; varied from 1.72 to 6.97 mg/mL) and &amp;amp;beta;-carotene bleaching (IC&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;50&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; varied from 3.42 to 5.66 mg/mL) assays after fractionation. However, there was an increase in the antioxidant activity following the chelating power assay with IC&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;50&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; varying between 6.91 to 3.44 mg/mL. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Caulerpa prolifera &amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;extracts obtained by successive extraction had the greatest antimicrobial activities against all tested strains (IZ &amp;amp;#61; 2-9 mm) when compared to those obtained by maceration.</abstract>

    <abstract>Instant noodles gained widespread popularity, resulting in a surge in global wheat consumption. However, concerns about the health implications of wheat-based products spurred the need for alternative ingredients in noodle production. The substitution of wheat flour with local resources, such as mocaf flour, and the enrichment of noodles with latoh (Caulerpa lentillifera), provided an opportunity to reduce wheat imports while enhancing the quality and potential health benefits of noodles. This study aimed to determine the optimal formulation, assess the characteristics, and evaluate the functional properties of wheat noodles that were substituted with mocaf flour and supplemented with latoh. The formulation of these noodles was conducted using design expert. The research encompassed a comprehensive analysis of physical, chemical, and organoleptic properties. The presence of latoh, in terms of chemical characteristics, increased the water and protein content in the noodles. On the physical side, it increased the final viscosity, setback, peak time, and elongation, as well as reduced the peak viscosity and breakdown. Meanwhile, the presence of mocaf increased carbohydrate content, peak viscosity, and breakdown value. The variations in noodle formulas only affected consumer acceptance of the appearance of the noodles; the noodle formula 99:1 (Mocaf:Latoh) had the most preferred appearance. Based on the sensory test parameters, the elongation value, and the tensile strength, noodles with optimal formulas were obtained, namely mocaf 63%, wheat 36% and latoh 1%. The optimum formula was similar to sample 10 (60:39:1) which exhibited characteristics such as a bright color, a rather smooth appearance with no cracks, a very soft mouthfeel, a bit springiness and elasticity, and a slightly non-sticky texture to the teeth without a fishy aroma. The essential and non-essential amino acids with the highest concentration contained in the Mocaf Noodles’ optimum formula were glutamate and leucine. Mocaf noodles with added latoh had low fat content but high carbohydrates and were rich in essential amino acids compared to other noodles. Additionally, they possessed sensory characteristics that were deemed acceptable by the panelists.</abstract>

    <title>HUBUNGAN KERAPATAN LAMUN Enhalus acoroides TERHADAP KERAPATAN ANGGUR LAUT Caulerpa sp. DI PERAIRAN KABUPATEN TAKALAR</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Rosdiana Rosdiana, Hadijah Hadijah, Ratnawati Ratnawati</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpa sp atau biasa disebut anggur laut merupakan alga laut yang tergolong dalam kelas Chorophyceae. Lamun merupakan tumbuhan berbunga (Angiospermae) yang mudah beradaptasi di perairan yang memiliki salinitas yang tinggi di dalam air. Salah satu permasalahan yang di hadapi yaitu pengembangan Caulerpa sp disulawesi selatan, sampai saat ini belum diketahui dengan pasti lokasi budidaya atau sebaran anggur laut (Caulerpa sp). Pengambilan data Caulerpa sp dan Lamun menggunakan metode transek kuadran. Ditemukan dua jenis lamun yaitu Enhalus acoroides dan Thalassia hemprichii. Sedangkan jenis anggur laut yaitu Caulerpa lentillifera dan Caulerpa racemosa. Nilai kerapatan jenis Enhalus acoroides yaitu 63,2 ind/m² dan Thalassia hemprichii yaitu 33,92 ind/m². jenis Enhalus acoroides memiliki kerapatan tertinggi yaitu pada stasiun 1 sebesar 34,24 ind/m² dan stasiun 2 sebesar 28,98 ind/m², kerapatan relatif Caulerpa racemosa yaitu pada stasiun 1 sebesar 83,50% dan stasiun 2 sebesar 68,37%. Caulerpa lentillifera dengan nilai kerapatan relatif pada stasiun 1 16,50% dan stasiun 2 sebesar 31,63%. Nilai kerapatan total jenis lamun sebesar 97,12 ind/m² dengan kondisi kerapatan lamun termasuk dalam skala 3 dengan nilai kerapatan 75-125 ind/m² (agak rapat). Kerapatan relatif anggur laut jenis Caulerpa racemosa sebesar 75,94% dan Caulerpa lentillifera sebesar 24,06%. Hubungan kerapatan jenis lamun terhadap kerapatan anggur laut memiliki korelasi derajat sempurna dengan nilai -923 (0,81 sampai dengan 1,00) dan bentuk hubungannya adalah negatif yang berarti semakin tinggi kepadatan jenis lamun, maka semakin rendah kepadatan relatif anggur laut begitu pula sebaliknya. Hasil analisis uji t diperoleh nilai Sig. sebesar 0,077 &amp;gt; 0,05 (alpha 5%) yang menunjukkan kerapatan jenis lamun tidak berpengaruh terhadap kerapatan relatif anggur laut. Caulerpa sp or commonly called sea grapes is a marine algae belonging to the Chorophyceae class. Seagrasses are flowering plants (Angiosperms) that are easily adaptable in waters that have high salinity in the water. (Audy &amp;amp; Gosari, 2012). One of the problems faced is the development of Caulerpa sp in South Sulawesi, until now the exact location of the cultivation or distribution of sea grapes (Caulerpa sp) has not been known. Caulerpa sp and seagrass data were collected using the quadrant transect method (Litaay, 2014). Two types of seagrass were found, namely Enhalus acoroides and Thalassia hemprichii. While the types of sea grapes are Caulerpa lentillifera and Caulerpa racemosa. The density value for Enhalus acoroides is 63.2 ind/m² and for Thalassia hemprichii is 33.92 ind/m². the Enhalus acoroides type had the highest density, namely at station 1 of 34.24 ind/m² and station 2 of 28.98 ind/m², the relative density of Caulerpa racemosa was at station 1 of 83.50% and station 2 of 68.37%. Caulerpa lentillifera with a relative density value at station 1 of 16.50% and station 2 of 31.63%. The total density value of seagrass species is 97.12 ind/m² with seagrass density conditions included in a scale of 3 with a density value of 75-125 ind/m² (rather dense). The relative density of Caulerpa racemosa grapes is 75.94% and Caulerpa lentillifera is 24.06%. The relationship between the density of seagrass species and the density of sea grapes has a perfect degree correlation with a value of -923 (0.81 to 1.00) and the opposite form is negative, which means that the higher the density of seagrass species, the lower the relative density of sea grapes and vice versa. The results of the t test analysis obtained the value of Sig. of 0.077 &amp;gt; 0.05 (5% alpha) which indicates the density of seagrass species does not affect the relative density of sea grapes.</abstract>

    <title>Taro (Colocasia esculenta) and sea grapes (Caulerpa lentillifera) as potential materials for making bioplastic</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>, Izel Joy Saray, Aileen Grace Fuentes, , Leomarich Casinillo, </authors>
    <abstract>Plastic pollution has become a global concern, and the country Philippines is one of the plastic waste generators worldwide. The accumulation of non-recyclable, single-use plastics threatens marine life and contributes to global warming. This study aimed to contribute to reducing plastic pollution and provide insights into sustainable alternatives to single-use plastics.  Hence, this research explores the potential of bioplastics as an alternative to traditional plastics. Specifically, this study primarily focused on developing bioplastics using taro and sea grapes as raw materials to provide an eco-friendly alternative to traditional plastics. The researcher aimed to investigate three different concentrations of bioplastic made from taro and sea grapes and evaluate their tensile strength, water absorbency, and biodegradability. The findings revealed that the second sample, consisting of 20 grams of taro starch, 15 mL of sea grape extract, two tablespoons of vinegar, 7.5 mL of glycerine, and 40 mL of water, exhibits the best outcome regarding its tensile strength, water absorbency, and biodegradability. Based on the results, the researchers concluded that bioplastics derived from taro starch and sea grape extract possess promising properties. The study highlights the importance of optimizing the concentration of raw materials to achieve desired characteristics in bioplastic production.</abstract>

    <abstract>Anggur laut, atau dikenal sebagai Caulerpa racemosa, adalah salah satu jenis alga hijau yang hidup meluas di beberapa perairan Indonesia. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengumpulkan data tentang pola penyebaran anggur laut di perairan Pantai Puntondo, Kabupaten Takalar, Sulawesi Selatan. Metode pengambilan data menggunakan transek garis sepanjang 100 meter ke arah laut dengan bingkai kuadrat 1 meter, dan setiap kuadrat dibagi menjadi 16 kotak kecil berukuran 25 cm. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa Caulerpa racemosa mendominasi di tiga stasiun penelitian. Stasiun 1 memiliki 663 individu dengan persentase 83%, stasiun 2 dengan 626 individu atau 76%, dan stasiun 3 dengan 139 individu dan persentase 80%. Sedangkan spesies Caulerpa lentillifera juga terdeteksi, tetapi dengan jumlah lebih rendah. Analisis menggunakan Indeks Morisita menunjukkan bahwa pola sebaran Caulerpa racemosa bersifat mengelompok. Hal ini mungkin dipengaruhi oleh respons terhadap perubahan cuaca dan musim. Penutupan relatif Caulerpa racemosa mencapai nilai tertinggi, yaitu 80%, sementara Caulerpa lentillifera hanya mencapai 20%. Frekuensi relatif Caulerpa racemosa juga lebih tinggi, sebesar 53%, dibandingkan dengan Caulerpa lentillifera sebesar 47%. Penelitian ini memberikan gambaran yang lebih jelas tentang dominansi dan pola penyebaran Caulerpa racemosa di Pantai Puntondo. Hasilnya dapat menjadi dasar untuk pemahaman lebih lanjut tentang ekologi anggur laut dan konservasi sumber daya alam di perairan tersebut. Sea weed, otherwise known as Caulerpa racemosa, are a type of green algae that live widely in several regions of Indonesia. This research aims to collect data about the distribution pattern of sea grapes in the waters of Puntondo Beach, Takalar Regency, South Sulawesi. The data collection method uses a 100 meter line transect towards the sea with a square frame of 1 meter, and each square is divided into 16 small squares measuring 25 cm. The results showed that Caulerpa racemosa dominated at the three research stations. Station 1 has 663 individuals with a percentage of 83%, station 2 with 626 individuals or 76%, and station 3 with 139 individuals and a percentage of 80%. Meanwhile, the Caulerpa lentillifera species was also detected, but in lower numbers. Analysis using the Morisita Index shows that the distribution pattern of Caulerpa racemosa is clustered. This may be influenced by responses to changes in weather and seasons. The relative cover of Caulerpa racemosa reached the highest value, namely 80%, while Caulerpa lentillifera only reached 20%. The relative frequency of Caulerpa racemosa was also higher, at 53%, compared to Caulerpa lentillifera at 47%. This research provides a clearer picture of the dominance and distribution pattern of Caulerpa racemosa on Puntondo Beach. The results can serve as a basis for further understanding of the ecology of sea grapes and conservation of natural resources in these waters.</abstract>

    <abstract>SUMMARY  The effects of four stressors, temperature, irradiance, desiccation and salinity, on the photochemical efficiency (Δ F/ ) of an edible green alga,  Caulerpa chemnitzia  var.  laetevirens  from Kagoshima, Japan, were determined for optimizing cultivation and shipping environments using a pulse amplitude modulation‐chlorophyll fluorometer. The Δ F/  remained stable at 24–34°C during the 3‐day temperature exposures ranging from 8 to 36°C; however, it dropped at higher and lower temperatures. During continuous exposure for 6 h to irradiance levels of 400 (low) and 1000 (high) μmol photons m −2  s −1  at 16, 24 and 32°C, the decrease in Δ F/  was pronounced at high irradiance. Moreover, Δ F/  also dropped at 16°C even under low irradiance, suggesting the occurrence of low temperature–light stress. Desiccation experiments under 50% humidity and up to 5 h of aerial exposure at 24°C and dim light (20 μmol photons m −2  s −1 ) indicated that Δ F/  was well tolerated within 1 h of desiccation; however, it dropped quickly as the desiccation period prolonged, suggesting that, if more than 20% of the interior water was lost, Δ F/  dropped progressively. However, during a similar experiment up to 14 days of aerial exposure under saturated humidity (99%) and dim light (12:12 h light/dark photocycle), as the interior water of the frond was maintained because of the saturated humidity, Δ F/  appeared to be well maintained for up to 5 days. Similar to desiccation, this alga exhibited stenohaline characteristics (30–40 psu) under the salinity gradient of 0–80 psu for up to 7 days of culture at 24°C and under dim light (12:12 h light/dark). In conclusion, this alga can be cultivated by modifying the techniques used for cultivating Japanese  Caulerpa lentillifera  and adjusting its environment accordingly. To ensure appropriate shipping conditions, it is essential to maintain saturated humidity in a plastic container at room temperature.</abstract>

    <title>CULTIVATION OF SEAWEED Caulerpa racemosa USING DIFFERENT SUBSTRATES ON A LABORATORY SCALE</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Jayusri Jayusri, Nunik Cokrowati, Nanda Diniarti</authors>
    <abstract>Caulepa racemosa is a type of sea grape from the group of green algae (Chlorophyceae) that can be found in Indonesian waters. Coastal communities use this species as a source of daily food. Besides being a food ingredient, C. racemosa can be used for medical purposes because it contains antioxidants. The distribution of C. racemosa and its density in waters depends on the type of substrate and season. The substrate in the cultivation container is an essential factor in cultivating C. racemosa. Various substrates have different characteristics and influence the growth of C. racemosa. This research aims to analyze the best substrate for the survival of seaweed on a laboratory scale. This research used an experimental method using a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) consisting of 4 treatments, namely different substrates of sand, coral, volcanic rock, and coral sand. The results of this research are that different types of substrates have a real influence on the survival rate of C. racemosa cultivated on a laboratory scale. Sand substrate gave the best results: a survival rate of 112.83%, a final weight of 22.56 g, and the highest antioxidant content on volcanic rock substrate of 83.19%. This research concludes that differences in substrate directly influence the survival rate and final weight of C.racemosa. The substrate that provided the best survival rate of 112.83% was sand substrate</abstract>

    <title>ADDITION OF Caulerpa racemosa EXTRACT ON RPS AND CLINICAL SIGNS OF VANAME SHRIMP AFTER Vibrio parahaemolyticus INFECTION</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Muhammad Hilmy Maulana, Woro Hastuti Satyantini, Gunanti Mahasri</authors>
    <abstract>Prevention of AHPND in shrimp can be done by giving immunostimulants, one of which comes fromseaweed extract, explicitly Caulerpa racemosa. This study aimed to determine the effect of the administration of Caulerpa racemosa extract on the relative percent survival (RPS), clinical signs, and behavioral changes of white shrimp after being infected with Vibrio parahaemolyticus. This study used a completely random design with five treatments and three replications, namely K-, K+, and three treatments with the addition of Caulerpa racemosa extract, names P1 (3 μg/g), P2 (6 μg /g), and P3 (9 μg/g). The infection process with Vibrio parahaemolyticus bacteria was carried out 24 hours after being injected with Caulerpa racemosa extract. The results of this study indicate that the highest Relative Percent Survival (RPS) value was P3. Clinical signs of shrimp infected with Vibrio parahaemolyticus were characterized by empty intestines and a whitened hepatopancreas. In addition, there were behavioral changes in shrimp infected with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, namely decreased appetite, passive shrimp movement at the bottom of the aquarium, and erratic swimming movement of shrimp. Based on these results, it could be said that the best treatment is in P3 with a dose of 9 μg/g. This study can provide the best quantity of C. racemosa extract to treat AHPND in shrimp.</abstract>

    <title>Proximate composition, sensory evaluation, and mineral content of noodles incorporated with green seaweed, Caulerpa lentillifera, powder</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Nur Syakilla, Patricia Matanjun, Ramlah George</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpa lentilliferahas gained popularity among consumers and researchers in recent years due to its good nutritional profile. The objective of this study is to explore whether the incorporation of different levels ofC. lentilliferapowder (CLP) concentration in noodles could potentially improve the noodle nutrient profile. The sensory attributes and the nutrient content of the developed noodles were evaluated. Five formulations of noodles containing different percentages of CLP, 0% (F1), 2.5% (F2), 5.0% (F3), 7.5% (F4), and 9.0% (F5) were developed. A sensory evaluation based on a 9-point hedonic scale involving 50 untrained panellists was conducted to determine the best formulation of noodles incorporated with CLP. All formulations were subjected to proximate analyses. From the sensory evaluation, the noodle with the best formulation was F2 (2.5% CLP) as it has the highest score in all sensory attributes tested among all formulations with CLP. Nutrient comparisons between F1 (0% CLP, F2 (2.5% CLP) and a commercial noodle in Malaysia were also made based on its mandatory nutritional facts and mineral profile. The incorporation of 2.5% CLP increased the mineral and protein content of the noodles significantly atp&lt; 0.05. In conclusion, CLP incorporation in noodles improves their nutrient profile, and the sensory attributes of noodles containing 2.5% CLP were found to be acceptable.</abstract>

    <title>Competitive effects of the macroalga &lt;i&gt;Caulerpa taxifolia&lt;/i&gt; on key physiological processes in the scleractinian coral &lt;i&gt;Turbinaria peltata&lt;/i&gt; under thermal stress</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>JianRong Fu, Jie Zhou, JiaLi Zhou, YanPing Zhang, Li Liu</authors>
    <abstract>An increased abundance of macroalgae has been observed in coral reefs damaged by climate change and local environmental stressors. Macroalgae have a sublethal effect on corals that includes the inhibition of their growth, development, and reproduction. Thus, this study explored the effects of the macroalga,  Caulerpa taxifolia , on the massive coral,  Turbinaria peltata , under thermal stress. We compared the responses of the corals’ water-meditated interaction with algae (the co-occurrence group) and those in direct contact with algae at two temperatures. The results show that after co-culturing with  C. taxifolia  for 28 days, the density content of the dinoflagellate endosymbionts was significantly influenced by the presence of  C. taxifolia  at ambient temperature (27 °C), from 1.3 × 10 6  cells cm −2  in control group to 0.95 × 10 6  cells cm −2  in the co-occurrence group and to 0.89 × 10 6  cells cm −2  in the direct contact group. The chlorophyll  a  concentration only differed significantly between the control and the direct contact group at 27 °C. The protein content of  T. peltata  decreased by 37.2% in the co-occurrence group and 49.0% in the direct contact group compared to the control group. Meanwhile, the growth rate of  T. peltata  decreased by 57.7% in the co-occurrence group and 65.5% in the direct contact group compared to the control group. The activity of the antioxidant enzymes significantly increased, and there was a stronger effect of direct coral contact with  C. taxifolia  than the co-occurrence group. At 30 °C, the endosymbiont density, chlorophyll  a  content, and growth rate of  T. peltata  significantly decreased compared to the control temperature; the same pattern was seen in the increase in antioxidant enzyme activity. Additionally, when the coral was co-cultured with macroalgae at 30 °C, there was no significant decrease in the density or chlorophyll  a  content of the endosymbiont compared to the control. However, the interaction of macroalgae and elevated temperature was evident in the feeding rate, protein content, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activity compared to the control group. The direct contact of the coral with macroalga had a greater impact than water-meditated interactions. Hence, the competition between coral and macroalga may be more intense under thermal stress.</abstract>

    <title>High temperature short time blanching enhances the antioxidative properties of sea grapes (Caulerpa racemosa) powder</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>E Windrayani, S A Budhiyanti, N Ekantari</authors>
    <abstract>Abstract                  Green alga sea grapes ( Caulerpa racemosa) were  consumed by Asian and Pacific Island people. It contains antioxidant compounds, such as phenols and caulerpin (CAU) that can potentially prevent disease. These sea grapes need to be blanched before drying to minimize oxidation damage. This research aims to understand the effect of temperature during hot water blanching (HWB) on the antioxidant activities, TPC, CAU, color, and moisture content of sea grapes powder. HWB temperatures used 70, 80, 90, and 100 °C at 20 seconds. The HWB had a more significant increase in antioxidant activity than control of sea grapes powder. The 100 °C had the highest value on ABTS, FRAP, and TPC, respectively 13.18 ± 0.13 (μg TE/g), 1.52 ± 0.03 (mg Ferro E/g), 0.96 ± 0,01(mg GAE/100 g). It is increasing its value because enzyme deactivation is better in high temperatures. Short time with high-temperature blanching can prevent the loss of bioactive compounds. CAU has specific aromatic rings, -NH, C=O, and -O-; all samples have peaks at these frequencies. Blanching has an intense green color (-a*) because it can increase color quality but has no significant result in moisture content. This study suggested blanching sea grapes can be done at 100°C for 20 seconds.</abstract>

    <abstract>Caulerpa racemosais a nutritious food option that has high demand. However, the production rate is lagging behind the increased demand. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of aqueous extract from various plants as an exogenous plant growth regulators (PGRs) in the morphology, growth, and nutrition ofC. racemosa. The natural PGRs used were coconut water (CW), shallots and coconut water (AESCW), maize (AEM), moringa leaves and mung beansprout (AEMBS), andKappaphycus alvarezii(AEKA). Fifty grams ofC. racemosawas soaked on the natural PGRs and was cultivated for 30 days with a sandy mud substrate. The results showed that the soaking ofC. racemosaon natural PGRs had a significant effect (p&lt; 0.05) on absolute growth, specific growth rate, and nutrients.C. racemosasoaked in aqueous shallot and coconut water showed the best absolute growth (214.32 ± 7.68 g) and SGR (5.55 ± 0.08%/day); meanwhile,C. racemosasoaked in coconut water had the best nutrition (protein, 9.54 ± 0.16%; fiber, 1.37 ± 0.21%; and fat, 0.42 ± 0.04%). The morphological analysis showed that soakingC. racemosaon natural PGRs resulted in long fronds, bigger stolons, a greener and fresher color, and more ramuli.</abstract>

    <title>Effects of solid-state fermentation of seaweed (Caulerpa racemosa) on
antioxidant assay and flavour profile</title>
    <year>2023</year>

    <abstract>The effects of solid-state fermentation (SSF) of Caulerpa racemosa on antioxidant properties (total phenolic content (TPC), 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, Ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)) and flavour profile were investigated. Additionally, sensory acceptability (9-Point Hedonic Test) and satiety analysis (10-Scale Intention) of oat drinks incorporated with SSF of C. racemosa were also studied. Results of SSF C. racemosa demonstrated that significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) higher content in TPC, DPPH, IC50 and FRAP (312.30±5.76 mg GAE/100 g, 25.96±0.17 mg AA/100 g, 46.22±0.31 mg/mL, 1106.72±21.82 mg TE/100 g and 206.80±4.76 mg GAE/100 g, respectively). Flavour profile analysis indicated the presence of antimicrobial volatile siloxane compounds; hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane and octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane. These -siloxane group compounds are known to have antioxidant, defoaming, and release coating properties. In addition, results obtained from the sensory evaluation showed that the addition of a different amount of SSF C. racemosa did not significantly (p&amp;gt;0.05) affect the acceptability of instant oat drinks. However, oat drinks incorporated with SSF C. racemosa significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) increased in fullness from the satiety study. Therefore, value-added SSF C. racemosa can be incorporated into food products to increase its nutritional properties and fullness without affecting the taste.</abstract>

    <authors>Tiago Tosta Alves Cruz, Jailson Bittencourt de Andrade, Sabrina Teixeira Martinez</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpin is a molecule that has several biological activities that are extremely important and sought after in the pharmaceutical market. It is found in algae of the genus Caulerpa, mainly in the species Caulerpa racemosa. This species of algae can be found beached in the sand along the Baía de Todos os Santos (Salvador, Bahia, Brazil). This project aims to study the use of the biomass of these marginalized algae. We extracted and analyzed the algae collected alive to evaluate the presence of caulerpin and then continue the research and processing of data with beached algae. The results showed that caulerpin was identified in all extractions. Therefore, the method Caulerpa racemosafor extracting and analyzing caulerpin was optimized and could be used in beached algae later.</abstract>

    <title>Anti-Obesity Effects of Marine Macroalgae Extract Caulerpa lentillifera in a Caenorhabditis elegans Model</title>

    <abstract>Obesity is a multifactorial disease characterized by an excessive accumulation of fat, which in turn poses a significant risk to health. Bioactive compounds obtained from macroalgae have demonstrated their efficacy in combating obesity in various animal models. The green macroalgae Caulerpa lentillifera (CL) contains numerous active constituents. Hence, in the present study, we aimed to elucidate the beneficial anti-obesity effects of extracts derived from C. lentillifera using a Caenorhabditis elegans obesity model. The ethanol (CLET) and ethyl acetate (CLEA) extracts caused a significant decrease in fat consumption, reaching up to approximately 50–60%. Triglyceride levels in 50 mM glucose-fed worms were significantly reduced by approximately 200%. The GFP-labeled dhs-3, a marker for lipid droplets, exhibited a significant reduction in its level to approximately 30%. Furthermore, the level of intracellular ROS displayed a significant decrease of 18.26 to 23.91% in high-glucose-fed worms treated with CL extracts, while their lifespan remained unchanged. Additionally, the mRNA expression of genes associated with lipogenesis, such as sbp-1, showed a significant down-regulation following treatment with CL extracts. This finding was supported by a significant decrease (at 16.22–18.29%) in GFP-labeled sbp-1 gene expression. These results suggest that C. lentillifera extracts may facilitate a reduction in total fat accumulation induced by glucose through sbp-1 pathways. In summary, this study highlights the anti-obesity potential of compounds derived from C. lentillifera extracts in a C. elegans model of obesity, mediated by the suppression of lipogenesis pathways.</abstract>

    <title>The effect of natural dye from Caulerpa sp. microcapsules on jelly drink quality</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>E.N. Dewi, L. Purnamayati</authors>
    <abstract>Jelly drink is a hydrocolloid-based drink with a low gel consistency, making it easy to consume. Dyes are food additives often added to jelly drinks to increase attractiveness. However, synthetic dyes are known to negatively affect health. Caulerpa sp. macroalgae are rich in chlorophyll pigment and have functional properties such as antioxidants and can be used as an organic dye, replacing synthetic dyes. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of Caulerpa sp. microcapsules as a natural dye on the physical and chemical properties of seaweed jelly drinks and to recommend concentrations. This study used chlorophyll from Caulerpa sp. in microcapsules that were added to jelly drinks with 0–4,000 ppm concentrations with 1,000 ppm intervals. The drinks’ physical properties were analyzed based on color, viscosity, dissolved solids, and syneresis level. The chemical properties analysis covered sugar, dietary fiber, chlorophyll, and total phenol levels, and antioxidant and organoleptic activity. The transition temperature of the jelly drinks was analyzed using Differential Scanning Calorimetry. A higher concentration of Caulerpa sp. microcapsules affected the characteristics of jelly drinks. The highest addition of Caulerpa sp. microcapsules resulted in increased chemical characteristics, however, lowered the soluble solids, degree of syneresis and panelist's acceptance. The best concentration was found at 2000 ppm. The Caulerpa sp. microcapsules has the potential as a natural colorant and improves product characteristics.</abstract>

    <abstract>The availability of sea grapes is still very limited, so activities are needed to support the preservation of sea grapes that are rich in mineral content. This research aims to determine growth, water quality, and comparison of mineral content found in C. lentillifera. This type of research is descriptive qualitative. As a research model, namely the mineral content of C. lentillifera in cultivation sites and free waters. On the growth of C. lentillifera, calculate the number of ramuli and water quality, such as pH, temperature, and salinity, with a water quality checker. Data on the mineral content in C. lentillifera was obtained by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). Based on the results of absorption measurements from several solutions at the cultivation location, the results for Potassium (K) were 2,592.364 mg/kg, Calcium (Ca) with a yield of 896.033 mg/kg, Iron (Fe) with a total of 174.323 mg/kg and for Zinc ( Zn) of 468.804 mg/kg. In the waters of Serangan, based on the results of absorption measurements from several standard solutions, Potassium (K) obtained results of 2,169,732 mg/kg, Calcium (Ca) with results of 1,677,829 mg/kg, Iron (Fe) with results of 1,669.607 mg /kg and for zinc (Zn) with a yield of 44,090 mg/kg.</abstract>

    <title>Brine-Processed Caulerpa lentillifera Macroalgal Stability: Physicochemical, Nutritional and Microbiological Properties</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Wanida Pan-utai, Prajongwate Satmalee, Safiah Saah, Yupadee Paopun, Montakan Tamtin</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpa lentillifera is a type of green macroalga that is commonly consumed as fresh seaweed, particularly in Southeast Asia. The effects of different salt types and concentrations on C. lentillifera during brine processing were investigated using table, sea and flower salt at 10–30% levels. The colour and texture of C. lentillifera varied across different treatments. After storage in brine for 12 weeks, lightness (L*) decreased, greenness (a*) decreased and yellowness (b*) increased while firmness increased in all treatments compared to fresh algae. The nutritional composition did not change significantly over time. To ensure the safety and quality of seaweed for consumption, the optimal salt level for brine processing should not exceed 30% table salt. The morphology and elements contained in different types of salt were also observed, and the microbiological safety of seaweed was evaluated. The popularity of Caulerpa macroalgae is rapidly increasing among consumers, leading to a growing demand for ready-to-eat Caulerpa products. However, food safety and security standards must be maintained.</abstract>

    <title>Entrapment of green seaweed Caulerpa Scalpelliformis for extracting Pb(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) metal ions from aqueous solutions</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Desconocido</authors>
    <abstract>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From this study, green seaweed Caulerpa Scalpelliformis is utilized as a sorbent for the removal of three metals such as lead (Pb), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn). Adsorption tests showed that maximum removal efficiency of 75.02% for Pb, 80% for Ni and 91.11% for Zn was obtained at an optimal equilibrium pH of 7 for Pb and 6 for Ni, Zn, 2g/L sorbent at an ionic strength of 100 mg/L of 30°C. Four isotherm models, such as Langmuir, Freundlich, Toth, and Sips used in this study to determine the correct fit model from test results. The toth model (R2=0.999) was well fit compared to other isotherms models based on correlation coefficients. Kinetic model results obtained at initial Pb, Ni and Zn concentrations revealed a high biosorption rate. In contrast, the results have been modelled effectively with the pseudo-first and second orders. As a result, tests with elutants found that 0.1M HCl is the perfect desorption elutant for three metal ions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;#x0D;</abstract>

    <abstract>Abstract  Nowadays, the use of seaweed derivatives in aquaculture has drawn attention for their potential as an immunostimulant and growth promotor. The sulfated polysaccharide extracted (SP E ) from green ( Caulerpa sp.; SPC) and brown ( Padina sp.; SPP) seaweeds with two concentrations (0.05% and 0.1%); nominated in four groups: SPC 0.05 , SPC 0.1 , SPP 0.05 , SPP 0.1 and control group (free of SP E ) were used for juvenile rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) diet. Fish ( N : 150; 8.5 ± 0.2 g) were selected aleatory distributed in 15 circular tanks (triplicate for the group) and fed test diets for 56 days. The outcomes revealed that the supplementation of SP E up to 1 g kg −1 failed to show significant differences in the organosomatic indices as compared to the control group. The most inferior protein value of dress‐out fish composition was observed in the fish fed the control diet, which was statistically lower than the SCP 0.1 group ( p  &amp;lt; 0.05), while no significant difference was observed in other macronutrient composition among the treatments. Total monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) had lower trend in the carcass of fish fed SP E supplemented diets, so that lowest MUFA were observed in SPC 0.05 group ( p  &amp;lt; 0.05; 25.22 ± 4.29%). The lowest value of docosahexaenoic acid was observed in the control diet compared to the SP E ‐supplemented diets ( p  &amp;lt; 0.05). The serum alternative complement pathway levels in all treatments tend to promote compared to the control treatment. A similar trend was observed for lysozyme activity. According to the results, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) value were highest in SPC 0.05 and SPC 0.1 compared to the other treatments ( p  &amp;lt; 0.05), while a further elevation of the SP E  Padina sp. extracted level (SPP 0.1 ) leads to a decrease in SOD value. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances of plasma was indicated not to influence by sulfated polysaccharide extracts in the refrigerated storage. The lowest serum stress indicators were observed in fish fed SPP 0.05 group postchallenge test. Taken together, our outcomes revealed that SP E of two species of seaweeds bestows benefits in some of the immunity and antioxidant system. Also, notable elevations in HUFA were observed in juvenile rainbow trout fed supplemented with SP E .</abstract>

    <authors>Bongkot Wichachucherd, Kattinat Sagulsawasdipan, Eknarin Rodcharoen</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpa lentillifera is a marine macroalgae widely consumed in Asia Pacific, including Thailand. Quality and freshness are the main criteria for consumers.  Chlorophyll is an important fundamental pigmentation and acts as green in C. lentillifera. It can be variable according to light and growth, and then it can indicate the quality of C. lentillifera products. This research aimed to observe changing chlorophyll contents in C. lentillifera after harvest during five days from two different months- May and June and two different ponds-ponds 1 and 2 by chlorophyll extraction and measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence. The result showed that the contents of total chlorophyll and chlorophyll A differed between months, but the pattern did not significantly change even in different months and ponds within five days after harvest.</abstract>

    <authors>Perdina Nursidika, Firdha Rachmawati</authors>
    <abstract>Produk pembersih kewanitaan dapat mengatasi permasalahan kewanitaan baik vaginosis, keputihan, maupun vaginitis. Selain memiliki efikasi yang baik, produk pembersih kewanitaan harus aman dan tidak memiliki efek samping terhadap penggunanya. Penggunaan produk alam menjadi salah satu alternatif bahan baku untuk pembuatan produk pembersih kewanitaan. Produk alam yang memiliki potensi tinggi yaitu golongan alga termasuk genus Caulerpa. Anggur laut (Caulerpa lentilifera) bersifat prebiotik yang meningkatkan pertumbuhan bakteri asam laktat, antibakteri, dan anti jamur. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menguji ekstrak air C. lentillifera untuk meningkatkan pertumbuhan bakteri asam laktat Lactobacillus acidophilus sehingga berpotensi sebagai bahan baku sabun pembersih kewanitaan. Metode penelitian dimulai dari determinasi, ekstraksi, penapisan fitokimia, dan modifikasi koefisien fenol untuk melihat pertumbuhan Lactobacillus acidophilus. Hasil menunjukkan ekstrak air C. lentillifera dapat menumbuhkan bakteri asam laktat hingga lebih dari 100 koloni, pada konsentrasi terkecil yaitu 2%, dan waktu kontak dua menit. Apabila dibandingkan dengan pembersih kewanitaan komersil, produk ini menghambat pertumbuhan bakteri asam laktat, terutama pembersih dengan kode B yang menghambat pada konsentrasi terkecil dan waktu kontak yang lama. Pembersih dengan kode P dapat menumbuhkan bakteri asam laktat pada konsentrasi terkecil 2% dan waktu kontak dua dan empat menit, namun pada konsentrasi tinggi dan paparan yang panjang pertumbuhan bakteri terhambat. Ekstrak air C. lentillifera juga menjaga pH tetap asam sehingga dapat menghambat pertumbuhan bakteri patogen dan menjaga keutuhan sel epitel. Pertumbuhan bakteri asam laktat dalam vagina menghambat pertumbuhan bakteri anaerob dan anaerob fakultatif penyebab vaginosis bakteri dan dapat mengurangi risiko inflamasi.  Kesimpulannya ekstrak air C. lentillifera berpotensi sebagai bahan baku sabun pembersih kewanitaan.   Kata kunci :  Caulerpa lentillifera, Lactobacillus acidophilus, pembersih kewanitaan</abstract>

    <title>Structure, preparation, and biological activity of sulfated polysaccharides from the genus Caulerpa (Chlorophyta): A review</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Yongzhou Chi, Peng Wang</authors>
    <abstract>Seaweeds have garnered attention in recent years as a potential source of useful metabolites and bioactive compounds. The genusCaulerpa, with representative species ofC. lentilliferaandC. racemosa, is a globally significant economic green seaweed and is recognized as a medicinal and edible plant. Sulfated polysaccharides represent one of the most important bioactive compounds in seaweeds. Increasing research confirms that sulfated polysaccharides from the genusCaulerpa(SPCs) possess a variety of biological activities, including immunomodulation, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-obesity effects, with commercial value for applications in the nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. This paper provides a systematic review of the extraction, purification, structural characteristics, and biological activities of SPCs, aiming to facilitate a better understanding of them. A series of issues, including the large-scale standardized preparation process of SPCs, their precise structure, and the structural basis for their bioactivity, still remain to be addressed.</abstract>

    <abstract>Green algae (Caulerpa racemosa) are known to contain bioactive compounds which are hypothesized to have antiviral activities against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of this study was to analyze the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of compounds extracted from the green alga Caulerpa racemosa using in silico analysis. The extract was obtained through maceration with 96% ethanol and the compounds present in the extract were identified through gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The binding affinities were analyzed in silico using the PyRx application and visualized in the PyMOL software. GC-MS analysis of Caulerpa racemosa extract showed 92 spectral peaks, each of which was assigned to a bioactive compound. Of the six compounds with a strong binding affinity, n-[1-(1-adamantan-1-yl-propyl)-2,5-dioxo-4-trifluoromethyl-imidazo lidin-4-yl] 4-methoxy-benzamide had the lowest score (-8.1 kcal/mol) against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease binding site, similar with that of remdesivir. The molecular dynamics calculations demonstrated that root means square deviation values of the selected inhibitors remained stable throughout a 15-nanosecond simulation. In conclusion, the in silico analysis suggests that Caulerpa racemosa extract is a potential antiviral candidate against SARS-CoV-2.</abstract>

    <title>Possible Interactions between Invasive Caulerpa Taxa and Native Macrozoobenthos: The Case Study of Favignana Island</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Anna Maria Mannino, Paolo Balistreri</authors>
    <abstract>Biological invasions are widely recognized as a major threat to native biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and services. Amongst the NIS recorded in the Mediterranean Sea, Chlorophyta species belonging to the genus Caulerpa (Caulerpa cylindracea, C. taxifolia and C. taxifolia var. distichophylla) have raised serious concerns due to their potential or ascertained impact on native benthic communities. During surveys carried out to monitor the occurrence and the coverage of Caulerpa species along the coasts of Favignana Island (Egadi Islands Marine Protected Area), we observed variations in C. cylindracea and C. taxifolia coverage and also some large invertebrates overgrown with thalli of both species.</abstract>

    <title>Sulfated Polysaccharide from Caulerpa racemosa Attenuates the Obesity-Induced Cardiometabolic Syndrome via Regulating the PRMT1-DDAH-ADMA with mTOR-SIRT1-AMPK Pathways and Gut Microbiota Modulation</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Nelly Mayulu, William Ben Gunawan, Moon Nyeo Park, Sanghyun Chung, Jin Young Suh, Hangyul Song, Rio Jati Kusuma, Nurpudji Astuti Taslim, Rudy Kurniawan, Felicia Kartawidjajaputra, Fahrul Nurkolis, Bonglee Kim</authors>
    <abstract>Our investigation intended to analyze the effects of sulfated polysaccharides from Caulerpa racemosa (SPCr) in attenuating obesity-induced cardiometabolic syndrome via regulating the protein arginine N-methyltransferase 1-asymmetric dimethylarginine-dimethylarginine dimethylamino-hydrolase (PRMT1-DDAH-ADMA) with the mammalian target of rapamycin-Sirtuin 1–5′ AMP-activated protein kinase (mTOR-SIRT1-AMPK) pathways and gut microbiota modulation. This is a follow-up study that used SPs from previous in vitro studies, consisting of 2,3-di-O-methyl-1,4,5-tri-O-acetylarabinitol, 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-D-mannopyranose, and type B ulvanobiuronicacid 3-sulfate. A total of forty rats were randomly divided into four treatment groups: Group A received a standard diet; Group B was provided with a diet enriched in cholesterol and fat (CFED); and Groups C and D were given the CFED along with ad libitum water, and daily oral supplementation of 65 or 130 mg/kg of body weight (BW) of SPCr, respectively. Group D showed the lowest low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and blood glucose levels, and the highest HDL level compared to the other groups in this study. These results in the group fed high-dose SPCr demonstrated a significant effect compared to the group fed low-dose SPCr (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), as well as in total cholesterol and blood glucose (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Supplementation with SPCr was also observed to have an upregulation effect on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha, interleukin 10, Sirtuin 1, DDAH-II, superoxide dismutase (SOD) cardio, and AMPK, which was also followed by a downregulation of PRMT-1, TNF-α, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, and mTOR. Interestingly, gut microbiota modulation was also observed; feeding the rats with a cholesterol-enriched diet shifted the gut microbiota composition toward the Firmicutes level, lowered the Bacteroidetes level, and increased the Firmicutes level. A dose of 130 mg/kg BW of SPCr is the recommended dose, and investigation still needs to be continued in clinical trials with humans to see its efficacy at an advanced level.</abstract>

    <abstract>Abstract                                      Caulerpa racemosa  (sea grape) widely known to the public as highly nutritious food ingredients whose availability only relies on nature. This resulted in the production of  C. racemosa  which was not continuous. One way to increase the production of seaweed seeds was by soaking the seaweed seeds in growth hormone. Natural growth regulators are found in many plants, such as coconut water and shallots, which contain the hormones cytokinin and auxin, respectively. This hormone is able to grow stems and roots if used in the right dosage. The treatments were soaking for 0 minutes (A), 30 minutes (B), 40 minutes (C) and 50 minutes (D). Seeds used as much as 600 g. Rearing was carried out for 30 days in a concrete pond filled with substrate in the form of sandy mud and sea water. The data obtained during the study included morphology, absolute weight growth, specific growth rate (SGR) and water quality. Data analysis with ANOVA and Duncan’s test was performed. Soaking  C. racemosa  in a combination of 25% coconut water and 10% crude extract of shallots for different lengths of time gave significantly different results (P&amp;lt;0.05). Treatment C showed the highest yield with absolute weight growth value of 214.33±9.4g. Water quality parameters within the appropriate range for the growth of  C. racemosa .</abstract>

    <abstract>Abstract  Seaweeds are a major contributor to global marine aquaculture production, with the biomass being mainly used, among others, for human nutrition, pharmaceutics, and cosmetics. However, green seaweeds are severely underrepresented, compared to red and brown macroalgae.  Caulerpa lentillifera  (known as “sea grapes” or “green caviar”) is an edible, green seaweed with a distinctive texture and various nutritional benefits. In this review, all articles on sea grapes published between 1900 and October 2022 and found in the scientific citation databases Scopus and Web of Science (search string: “caulerpa” AND “lentillifera”) were grouped by research topic and the intended application following the PRISMA approach. 51% of the 130 articles included in the review focused on the topic of “Biochemical composition”, followed by “Water treatment” (18%) and “Ecophysiology” (15%). The most prominent application was “Pharmaceutics”, followed by “Cultivation” and “Fundamental research”. In order to provide a knowledge base to researchers and practitioners of C. lentillifera aquaculture, research that was simultaneously grouped under one of the topics “Biochemical composition”, “Water treatment”, or “Ecophysiology” and the applications “Cultivation”, “Nutritional value” or “Post-harvest” was summarized in more detail. Light management of sea grapes, their use as a high-value co-culture species and the capacity to bioremediate nutrients, as well as their short shelf-life were identified as important areas of research interest. The assessment revealed several knowledge gaps, for example the need for intra-species comparisons of  C. lentillifera  biochemical composition across spatial and temporal scales.</abstract>

    <authors>Thị Tưởng Lê, Ngọc Bội Vũ</authors>
    <abstract>Rong nho là loài rong có giá trị dinh dưỡng cao, được nuôi trồng nhiều tại các vùng biển của Việt Nam. Hiện nay, Việt Nam có tổng diện tích nuôi trồng rong nho khoảng 600 ha, năng suất bình quân mỗi ha đạt 20 tấn một năm. Tuy nhiên, mức độ tiêu thụ rong nho khá chậm do rong nho khó bảo quản, nhanh chóng bị hư hỏng sau thu hoạch. Một trong những lý do gây nên sự hư hỏng của rong là rong bị tổn thương cơ học tại vị trí cắt khi thu hoạch. Mục đích của nghiên cứu là xác định các điều kiện thích hợp nuôi trồng lại rong nho để nâng cao chất lượng nguyên liệu ban đầu. Kết quả nghiên cứu cho thấy các điểu kiện môi trường bao gồm: tỷ lệ rong trong môi trường nước biển: 2%; thời gian nuôi: 2 ngày; cường độ ánh sáng từ 10-15 klux, nhiệt độ môi trường 28°C, lượng oxy hòa tan trong nước: 8 mg/l. Rong nho trồng lại trong điều kiện này có tỷ lệ rong lành vết thương 95,7%, tỷ lệ rong mọc nhánh mới 0%, hàm lượng vitamin C đạt 0,265 mg/g, hàm lượng protein tổng số đạt 13,1%, hàm lượng lipid tổng số đạt 2,89%, hàm lượng chất xơ tổng số đạt 3,67% và chất lượng cảm quan rong nho đạt loại tốt theo TCVN 3215-79.</abstract>

    <title>The Effect of Maltodextrin Concentration and Roasting Time on the Physicochemical and Sensory Characteristics of  Nori Snack Made from Sea Grape (Caulerpa sp.)</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Anggita Ulfia Savitri, Jariyah Jariyah, Ratna Yulistiani</authors>
    <abstract>Nori snack is dried edible seaweed, which is made from drying and roasting so its texture is crispy and thin. Commercial nori snack is usually made from Porphyra seaweed which cannot be cultivated in Indonesia. Sea grapes (Caulerpa sp.), a local seaweed that is widely cultivated in Indonesia, have the potential to be used as an alternative material for nori snacks. The formation of nori with the addition of Eucheuma cottonii gives a nori snack texture that tends to be elastic and less crunchy. Crispness is the main parameter to consider in choosing nori snacks. The addition of maltodextrin as a texture enhancer is needed to give a compact and crispy texture, and roasting time can also increase the level of crispness in nori products. This study aims to determine the physicochemical and organoleptic characteristics of sea grape nori snacks (Caulerpa sp.). Factorial completely randomized design (CDR) with two factors. Factor I was the maltodextrin concentration (1, 2, and 3%), while factor II was a roasting time (1, 2, and 3 minutes) and two replications. The data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and followed by Duncan’s New Multiple Range Test (DNMRT) at the 5% significance level. The best treatment was the addition of 3% maltodextrin and a roasting time of 3 minutes. The results obtained were a moisture content of 6.13%, ash content of 12.45%, protein content of 17,07%, a yield of 6.22%, a breaking strength of 5.23%, and an average score of preference for the aroma of 2.8 (dislike), the colour of 3.5 (standard), the taste of 4.05 (like), and crispness of 4.10 (like).&amp;#x0D;</abstract>

    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Annisa Soenarto, Hadijah Hadijah, Erni Indrawati</authors>
    <abstract>Anggur laut Caulerpa lentillifera termasuk spesies populer yang kaya akan mineral, vitamin, dan asam lemak, mengandung protein sebesar  12,49 %; lemak sebesar 0,86 % dalam 100 gr berat , serta senyawa bioaktif diantaranya sesquiterpenoid, diterpenoid, sitosterol dan caulerpenin yang berfungsi sebagai antikanker, antioksidatif, antidiabetes, membantu penurunan kolesterol dan mencegah penyakit kardiovaskular. Spesies rumput laut ini memiliki nilai ekonomis yang cukup tinggi. Anggur laut C. lentillifera memiliki nilai ekonomis yang cukup tinggi, hal ini karena rasanya menyerupai telur ikan caviar, sehingga dikenal sebagai “green caviar” atau biasa juga dikenal dengan bahasa lokal lawi-lawi bulaeng (Makassar), Latoh (Jawa). Saat ini harga di pasar lokal berkisar antara Rp 50.000 – Rp 280.000. Salah satu permasalahan yang dihadapi di dalam pengembangan anggur laut di Sulawesi Selatan adalah sampai saat ini belum diketahui dengan pasti lokasi sebaran anggur laut C. lentillifera selain di Perairan Puntondo Desa Punaga Kabupaten Takalar Sulawesi Selatan, padahal informasi ini sangat penting sebagai data dasar untuk lokasi budidaya dan sekaligus penyediaan bibit anggur laut. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menghasilkan data pola sebaran anggur laut C. lentillifera di perairan puntondo Kabupaten Takalar Sulawesi Selatan.Hasil Penelitian ini diharapkan dapat membantu para pembudidaya anggur laut untuk menemukan sumber bibit yang dapat dikembangkan di daerah lain. Penelitian dilaksanakan mulai bulan Agustus 2022 sampai dengan  Oktober 2022 yang diawali dengan Menyusun jadwal, schedule riset dan survey lokasi. Selanjutnya dilakukan pengambilan sampel pada beberapa titik tempat tumbuhnya anggur laut C. lentillifera di perairan Kabupaten Takalar. Sampel yang diambil berupa jenis-jenis Caulerpa yang tumbuh pada bingkai kuadrat berukuran 25x25 cm yang diletakkan pada garis transek di sepanjang pantai. Sampel substrat dan kualitas air berupa salinitas, pH, suhu, kecerahan, kecepatan arus dan kekeruhan diukur pada saat pengambilan sampel secara insitu. Lokasi pengambilan sampel ditetapkan sebanyak tiga (3) titik pengambilan sampel dimana Caulerpa tumbuh. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa pola sebaran C. lentillifera di Perairan Desa Puntondo Takalar Sulawesi Selatan berpola mengelompok dengan indeks Morisita sebesar 12 (nilai &amp;gt;1). Selanjutnya nilai penutupan relative sebesar 69% untuk C. lentillifera dan 31% untuk C. rasemosa.  Frekuensi penyebaran C. lentillifera ditemukan pada semua stasiun pengamatan sedangkan C. Rasemosa hanya ditemukan pada stasiun 1 dan 2 Sea grape Caulerpa lentillifera is a popular species rich in minerals, vitamins and fatty acids, containing 12.49% protein; fat of 0.86% in 100 gram weight, as well as bioactive compounds including sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids, sitosterol and caulerpenin which function as anticancer, antioxidative, antidiabetic, help reduce cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular disease. This seaweed species has a fairly high economic value. C. lentillifera sea grape has a fairly high economic value, this is because it tastes like caviar fish eggs, so it is known as "green caviar" or commonly also known in the local language lawi-lawi bulaeng (Makassar), Latoh (Java). Currently the price in the local market ranges from IDR 50,000 – IDR 280,000. One of the problems encountered in the development of sea grapes in South Sulawesi is that until now it is not known with certainty the location of the distribution of C. lentillifera grapes other than in Puntondo Waters, Punaga Village, Takalar Regency, South Sulawesi, even though this information is very important as basic data for cultivation locations. and at the same time provision of sea grape seeds. This study aims to produce data on the distribution pattern of C. lentillifera sea grapes in Puntondo waters, Takalar Regency, South Sulawesi. The results of this study are expected to help sea grape cultivators find seed sources that can be developed in other areas. The research was carried out from August 2022 to October 2022 which began with compiling schedules, research schedules and site surveys. Furthermore, sampling was carried out at several points where the sea grape C. lentillifera grew in the waters of Takalar Regency. The samples taken were Caulerpa species growing in a 25x25 cm squared frame placed on the transect line along the coast. Substrate samples and water quality in the form of salinity, pH, temperature, brightness, current velocity and turbidity were measured during in-situ sampling. Sampling locations were determined as many as three (3) sampling points where Caulerpa grew. The results showed that the distribution pattern of C. lentillifera in the waters of Puntondo Takalar Village, South Sulawesi, was clustered with a Morisita index of 12 (value &amp;gt; 1). Furthermore, the relative closing values were 69% for C. lentillifera and 31% for C. racemosa. The distribution frequency of C. lentillifera was found at all observation stations, while C. racemosa was only found at stations 1 and 2.</abstract>

    <title>Sea grape (Caulerpa lentillifera) aquaculture in Van Phong Bay, Viet Nam: Evaluation of the post-harvest quality</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Lara Elisabeth Stuthmann, Hoang Trung Du, Beatrice Brix da Costa, Andreas Kunzmann, Karin Springer</authors>
    <abstract>Abstract   Caulerpa lentillifera,  known as `sea grapes´ or `green caviar´, is increasingly in demand as a sea vegetable for human consumption. The seaweed is cultivated in ponds in the Khánh Hòa province in Van Phong Bay, Viet Nam, during the dry season (March-October). The harvested sea grape fronds are graded into different qualities based on their physical characteristics for retail on the local market or for export. Based on systematic observations of sea grape fronds of two different qualities, the frond weight, frond length and rachis coloration were identified as physical characteristics important for grading. Fronds of the best quality had significantly longer (12.59 ± 2.89 vs 10.01 ± 2.51 cm) and heavier (2.37 ± 0.59 vs 1.60 ± 0.5 g) fronds with darker rachis than the other quality group. However, a logistic regression model revealed that frond weight was the best predictor of frond quality. The physiological parameter of F v /F m  was slightly different between the qualities, but always with means &amp;gt; 0.7, whereas the antioxidant activity and the total phenolic content were similar (98.34 ± 19.22 vs 95.96 ± 24.98 mmol TE (100 g) −1  DW and 163.8 ± 20.14 vs 149.85 ± 15.44 mg GAE (100 g) −1  DW). To the best of our knowledge, this study took a first approach to identify quality characteristics of sea grape fronds from Van Phong Bay, Viet Nam, which can serve as a basis for adjusting cultivation parameters to improve the harvest quality by developing cultivation and post-harvest protocols. However, further research is needed to investigate the effect of certain cultivation parameters on the specific frond characteristics.</abstract>

    <title>Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties of a Hydrocolloid-Based Functional Food Fortified with Caulerpa lentillifera: A D-Optimal Design Approach</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Nor Atikah Husna Ahmad Nasir, Mohd Hafis Yuswan, Nor Nadiah Abd Karim Shah, Aswir Abd Rashed, Kazunori Kadota, Yus Aniza Yusof</authors>
    <abstract>This study introduced a D-optimal design mixture to assess the physicochemical properties of a hydrocolloid-based functional food fortified with C. lentillifera. The combination incorporated vital jelly constituents, including extract (10–15%), sweeteners (20–29%), gelling agents (k-carrageenan and locust bean gum (LBG)), and preservatives (0–0.05%). The dependent variables were pH, Total Soluble Solid (TSS) value, and moisture content (MS). By employing the D-optimal design approach, a quadratic polynomial model was developed, demonstrating strong correlations with the experimental data with coefficient determinations (R2) of 0.9941, 0.9907, and 0.9989 for pH, TSS, and MS, respectively. Based on the D-optimal design, the study identified the optimum combination of significant factors with a desirability of 0.917, comprising 14.35% extract, 23.00% sucrose, 21.70% fructose, 26.00% k-carrageenan, 13.00% LBG, 1.95% CaCl2, and 0% methylparaben. The percentage of residual standard error (RSE) was less than 5%, indicating the reliability of the developed model. Furthermore, color analysis revealed significant differences among the jellies (p &amp;lt; 0.05). HPLC analysis demonstrated that the total sugar content in the fortified jellies was 28% lower compared to commercial jelly. Meanwhile, the bitterness level according to e-tongue showed a reduction of up to 90.5% when compared to the extract. These findings provide a valuable benchmark for the development of functional food products, ensuring their quality, safety, and extended shelf-life.</abstract>

    <abstract>Caulerpa spp; is a remarkably potential seaweed due to its pharmacological importance, high nutritional compositions, biological activities , and human health benefit. It is a species of ulvophyte green algae inhabiting mostly in the intertidal and shallow sub-tidal coastal regions in the Asia- Pacific and commonly consumed in South-East Asia for its high contents of vitamins and minerals. Besides its culinary uses, it is well-reported for its antibacterial, antifungal, diabetes, blood pressure, and lipid-lowering properties. However, to date, no extensive assessment of the diversity, distribution, and biological activity assay of these seaweeds found on the Bangladesh coast has been carried out. This study aimed at anti-inflammatory and analgesic studies of 50% ethanolic extract of Caulerpa racemosa. collected from St. Martin's Island, Bangladesh. Consequently, secondary metabolites such as steroids, flavonoids, glycoside, and saponin were also detected in the phytochemical assay.

    <title>Exploring Metabolites Of Green Algae Caulerpa Spp.  To Discover Putative Inhibitors Of Dpp-4, A New Antidiabetic Target Protein</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Walter Balansa</authors>
    <abstract>Diabetes mellitus (DM) remains a serious global health threat, claiming a million lives every year and affecting nearly 9% of the adult population who suffer from this impaired insulin sensitivity disease. The Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme has recently attracted attention because of its crucial role in insulin signaling, making this enzyme an interesting and emerging target for antidiabetic drug discovery. This study aimed to explore reported metabolites from marine algae of the genus Caulerpa as DPP-4 inhibitors through computational studies using CB-dock 2, Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler, SwissAdme, and pkCMS. Molecular docking allowed the identification of 7 hit compounds with strong binding affinities (8.4 kcal to 9.3 kcal/mol) against DPP-4 target enzyme PDB ID: 3G4I. Four hits showed stronger binding affinity than two DPP-4 specific inhibitors and FDA-approved antidiabetic drugs, sitagliptin (8.4 kcal/mol) and linagliptin (9.0 kcal/mol). Following a molecular modification of the hit compounds using a bioisosterism-like approach and ADMET evaluation with pkCMS, three putative DPP-4 inhibitors were identified. They showed either stronger binding affinities or better ADMET profiles than sitagliptin and linagliptin, suggesting their promising potential as DPP-4 inhibitors. However, further optimized bioisoterism, in silico and in vivo studies, and clinical-based trials are required to confirm their antidiabetic activity.

    <abstract>Background: Obesity is a global problem which increasing simultaneously. The high-fat accumulation in the body will result from mild chronic inflammation. Developing a local drink based on seagrapes (Caulerpa racemose) is thought to have a high antioxidant capacity and the potential to become an alternative therapeutic drink for obese people. Seagrapes are easily damaged, so proper drying is needed to maintain antioxidant potential and assisted by adding gum arabic to increase the acceptability. Objectives: To analyze the antioxidant capacity and sensory of sea grapes powder drink (Caulerpa racemose). Methods: The design experiment research was utterly randomized and only used one gum Arabic treatment with a 2.5, 5, and 10% concentration and three replication as sea grapes powder drink samples. The samples were analyzed to seek the antioxidant capacity of DPPH (2,2-diphenyi-1-picrylhydrazyl), CUPRAC (Cupric Ion Reducing Antioxidant Capacity), and FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power). Then research data were analyzed by employing ANOVA  and Duncan's follow-up test. Results: The higher concentration of gum Arabic has significantly increased the antioxidant capacity. DPPH, CUPRAC, and FRAP values in 10% gum Arabic concentration were 13.21±0.1 mg/100 g, 25.26±0.5 mg, and 2.89±0.3mg/g. Based on the sensory test results, the panelists preferred the 10% gum Arabic concentration because the color is lighter, can minimize odor and viscosity, and taste better. Conclusions: Seagrapes powder drink with a concentration of 10% gum Arabic has the potential as a therapeutic obesity with the highest antioxidant capacity and is sensory acceptable.</abstract>

    <title>Can the Invasive Seaweed Caulerpa cylidracea Represent a New Trophic Resource in the Mediterranean Sea?</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Lucia Rizzo, Tomás Vega Fernández</authors>
    <abstract>Non-indigenous species (NIS) represent one of the greatest threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, altering invaded habitats, competing with native species, and eventually becoming pests. The Mediterranean Sea is a marine biodiversity hotspot, with its coasts being densely populated and its living resources fished since ancient times. As a result of such a long history of exploitation, the whole basin is exposed to a wide array of human pressures, with their combined effects on marine ecosystems being amplified by ongoing climate change. Caulerpa cylindracea Sonder, 1845, is a non-indigenous invasive seaweed widely distributed in the coastal habitats of the Mediterranean Sea, which ultimately affects marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Here, a systematic literature analysis on the consumption of the NIS Caulerpa cylindracea by Mediterranean native and NIS species is provided, focusing on the benefits and drawbacks for the native biota and human health. The present review aims to synthetise knowledge and provide tools to manage the occurrence of the invasive seaweed C. cylindracea in the Mediterranean Sea, encouraging an ecosystem-based approach to the management of the ecological, economic, and social effects of the successful expansion of this NIS.</abstract>

    <title>Pro-Apoptotic Activity and Cell Cycle Arrest of Caulerpa sertularioides against SKLU-1 Cancer Cell in 2D and 3D Cultures</title>

    <abstract>Cancer is a disease with the highest mortality and morbidity rate worldwide. First-line drugs induce several side effects that drastically reduce the quality of life of people with this disease. Finding molecules to prevent it or generate less aggressiveness or no side effects is significant to counteract this problem. Therefore, this work searched for bioactive compounds of marine macroalgae as an alternative treatment. An 80% ethanol extract of dried Caulerpa sertularioides (CSE) was analyzed by HPLS-MS to identify the chemical components. CSE was utilized through a comparative 2D versus 3D culture model. Cisplatin (Cis) was used as a standard drug. The effects on cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle, and tumor invasion were evaluated. The IC50 of CSE for the 2D model was 80.28 μg/mL versus 530 μg/mL for the 3D model after 24 h of treatment exposure. These results confirmed that the 3D model is more resistant to treatments and complex than the 2D model. CSE generated a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, induced apoptosis by extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, upregulated caspases-3 and -7, and significantly decreased tumor invasion of a 3D SKLU-1 lung adenocarcinoma cell line. CSE generates biochemical and morphological changes in the plasma membrane and causes cell cycle arrest at the S and G2/M phases. These findings conclude that C. sertularioides is a potential candidate for alternative treatment against lung cancer. This work reinforced the use of complex models for drug screening and suggested using CSE’s primary component, caulerpin, to determine its effect and mechanism of action on SKLU-1 in the future. A multi-approach with molecular and histological analysis and combination with first-line drugs must be included.</abstract>

    <authors>Ni Putu Ermi Hikmawanti, Sherley, Mutia Agustin</authors>
    <abstract>Background: The edible green algae Caulerpa racemosa (Forsskal) J. Agardh (Caulerpaceae), also known as “sea grape”, is an excellent source of phenolic compounds known for their activity to reduce free radicals.Objectives: The research aims to evaluate the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of C. racemosa (70% ethanol extracts) obtained from different extraction methods, such as maceration, Soxhlet, and ultrasound.Methods: Total phenolics of the extracts were determined by the colorimetry method using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Total phenol content was expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per g extract. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical was used to assess the antioxidant activity of the extracts.Results: the ethanol extract of C. racemosa obtained from the ultrasonic methods had the highest phenolic content (39.38 mg GAE/g) compared to other extraction methods (Soxhlet was 37.31 mg GAE/g and maceration was 22.05 mg GAE/g). The IC50 value against DPPH of the C. racemosa ethanol extracts using ultrasonic, Soxhlet, and maceration was 352.95, 365.73, and 375.84 μg/mL, respectively.Conclusions: the variation of the extraction methods affected the total phenolics content of C. racemosa ethanol extracts and their antioxidant activity. We reported here the potential of C. racemosa extracts as an antioxidant raw material from marine plants for medicinal, nutraceutical, cosmetics, and food products; however, more research is needed.</abstract>

    <abstract>Rumput laut merupakan salah satu jenis komoditas perikanan yang banyak dimanfaatkan baik sebagai bahan baku makanan, industri, obat-obatan, dan kosmetik. Hal ini menyebabkan nilai ekonomi rumput laut dapat membantu perekonomian masyarakat dan dapat menambah devisa negara. Rumput laut merupakan salah satu penghasil karotenoid terbesar karena rumput laut hijau secara umum mengandung senyawa klorofil a dan b serta senyawa karoten yang dapat berfungsi sebagai antioksidan. Faktor yang mempengaruhi kandungan karotenoid yaitu jarak tanam bibit rumput laut. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui pengaruh jarak tanam pada sistem patok dasar terhadap kandungan karotenoid Caulerpa lentilifera serta mengetahui jarak tanam ideal yang memberikan pengaruh optimal pada kandungan karotenoid Caulerpa lentilifera. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode eksperimental dengan pola Rancanagan Acak Lengkap (RAL) dengan 6 perlakuan dan 3 kali ulangan dengan perlakuan yaitu Kontrol (jarak tanam 25 cm), P1 (jarak tanam 20 cm), P2 (jarak tanam 30 cm), P3 (jarak tanam 35 cm), P4 (jarak tanam 40 cm), P5 (jarak tanam 45 cm). Data yang didapatkan kemudian dianalisis menggunakan sidik ragam (ANOVA) dengan taraf kepercayaan 95% dan untuk mengetahui pertumbuhan terbaik dilakukan uji lanjut menggunakan uji BNT. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa jarak tanam yang diterapkan pada sistem patok dasar tidak memberikan pengaruh terhadap kandungan karotenoid pada Caulerpa lentilifera, namum berpengaruh terhadap pertumbuhan mutlak dan laju pertumbuhan spesifik. Jarak tanam 30 cm merupakan jarak terbaik untuk pertumbuhan Caulerpa lentilifera dengan pertumbuhan mutlak 128,917 g dan laju pertumbuhan spesifik 4,965%, namun perbedaan jarak tanam tidak berpengaruh terhadap kandungan karotenoid. Kesimpulan dari penelitian ini adalah perbedaan jarak tanam sistem patok dasar tidak memberikan pengaruh terhadap kandungan karotenoid pada C. lentilifera, namum berpengaruh terhadap pertumbuhan mutlak dan laju pertumbuhan spesifik. Tidak ditemukan jarak tanam ideal untuk meningkatkan kandungan karotenoid pada C. lentilifera, karena setiap perlakuan cenderung memiliki kandungan karotenoid yang relatif sama.</abstract>

    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Novriaman Pakpahan, Darul Aswat</authors>
    <abstract>Anggur laut memiliki kandungan nutrisi yang baik bagi kesehatan. Anggur laut diketahui memiliki rasa asin dan flavour seafood yang sangat kuat sehingga aplikasinya dalam formulasi produk pangan perlu mempertimbangkan daya terima. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mempelajari pengaruh penambahan anggur laut terhadap analisis proksimat dan daya terima cracker. Penelitian dilakukan dengan eksperimental laboratororium menggunakan rancangan acak lengkap. Percobaan dilakukan dengan menambahkan bubur anggur laut sebanyak 0 %; 10 %; 20 %; 30 % dan 40 %. Selanjutnya, data dianalisis menggunakan sidik ragam (p&amp;lt;0,05) dan uji Duncan.

    <abstract>Exploration of seaweeds to unravel their bioactive metabolites from the perspective of wider applications gained substantial importance. The present study was performed to investigate the total phenolic, flavonoid, tannin content, antioxidant activity and antibacterial potential of various solvent extracts of green seaweed Caulerpa racemosa. The methanolic extract showed higher phenolic (11.99 ± 0.48 mg gallic acid equivalents/g), tannin (18.59 ± 0.54 mg tannic acid equivalents/g) and flavonoid (33.17 ± 0.76 mg quercetin equivalents/g) content than other extracts. Antioxidant activity was determined by using 2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assay with different concentrations of C. racemosa extracts. The methanolic extract showed higher scavenging potential in both the DPPH and ABTS activity with the inhibition value of 54.21 ± 1.39% and 76.62 ± 1.08%, respectively. Bioactive profiling was also identified by using Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) techniques. These studies revealed the presence of valuable bioactive compounds in C. racemosa extracts and these compounds might be responsible for antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer and anti-mutagenic properties. Major compounds identified in GC-MS were 3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol, 3-hexadecene and Phthalic acid. In terms of antibacterial activity, C. racemosa has promising antibacterial potential against aquatic pathogens Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas veronii and Aeromonas salmonicida. Further evaluation studies focusing aquatic related aspects would reveal the novel bioproperties and applications of C. racemosa.</abstract>

    <abstract>Green alga Caulerpa racemosa is an underexploited species of macroalgae, even though it is characterized by a green color that indicates an abundance of bioactive pigments, such as chlorophyll and possibly xanthophyll. Unlike chlorophyll, which has been well explored, the composition of the carotenoids of C. racemosa and its biological activities have not been reported. Therefore, this study aims to look at the carotenoid profile and composition of C. racemose and determine their biological activities, which include antidiabetic, anti-obesity, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxicity in vitro. The detected carotenoids were all xanthophylls, which included fucoxanthin, lutein, astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, zeaxanthin, β-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin based on orbitrap-mass spectrometry (MS) and a rapid ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) diode array detector. Of the seven carotenoids observed, it should be highlighted that β-carotene and canthaxanthin were the two most dominant carotenoids present in C. racemosa. Interestingly, the carotenoid extract of C. racemosa has good biological activity in inhibiting α-glucosidase, α-amylase, DPPH and ABTS, and the TNF-α and mTOR, as well as upregulating the AMPK, which makes it a drug candidate or functional antidiabetic food, a very promising anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory. More interestingly, the cytotoxicity value of the carotenoid extract of C. racemosa shows a level of safety in normal cells, which makes it a potential for the further development of nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals.</abstract>

    <abstract>Melanogenesis involves a synthesis of melanin pigment and is regulated by tyrosinase. The addition of whitening agents with tyrosinase-inhibiting properties in cosmetics is becoming increasingly important. In this study, the ethanolic extracts from twelve seaweeds were assessed for tyrosinase-inhibiting activity using mushroom tyrosinase and melanin synthesis in B16F10 melanoma cells. The highest mushroom tyrosinase inhibition (IC50) was observed with Lobophora challengeriae (0.15 ± 0.01 mg mL−1); treatment was more effective than kojic acid (IC50 = 0.35 ± 0.05 mg mL−1), a well-known tyrosinase inhibitor. Three seaweeds, Caulerpa racemosa, Ulva intestinalis, and L. challengeriae, were further investigated for their ability to reduce melanogenesis in B16F10 cells. The ethanolic extracts of C. racemosa, U. intestinalis, and L. challengeriae showed inhibitory effects by reducing melanin and intracellular tyrosinase levels in B16F10 cells treated with α-melanocyte stimulating hormone in a dose-dependent manner. C. racemosa (33.71%) and L. challengeriae (36.14%) at 25 µg mL−1 reduced melanin production comparable to that of kojic acid (36.18%). L. challengeriae showed a stronger inhibition of intracellular tyrosinase (decreased from 165.23% to 46.30%) than kojic acid (to 72.50%). Thus, ethanolic extracts from C. racemosa, U. intestinalis, and L. challengeriae can be good sources of natural tyrosinase inhibitors and therapeutic or cosmetic agents in the future.</abstract>

The results of the characteristic test of the extract obtained water content (14.49%) and ash content (0.30%), these values ??did not exceed the standard extract values. The results of the phytochemical analysis showed that 96% ethanol extract of sea grapes (C.racemosa) contained steroid/triterpenoid compounds, flavonoids, saponins, and alkaloids. The levels of heavy metals found were still within safe limits, namely, lead (Pb) (TTD), mercury (Hg) (&amp;lt;0.001 ppm), Arsenic (As) (&amp;lt;0.001 ppm), and Cadmium (Cd) (0.005 ppm). The test results showed that the sea grape (C.racemosa) used was safe and free from heavy metal contamination. The results of antioxidant analysis on 96% ethanol extract of sea grape (C.racemosa) obtained an IC50 value of 237.51 mg/L. The IC50 value for quercetin is 9.52 mg/L. The results of antioxidant analysis on 96% ethanol extract of sea grapes (C.racemosa) were included in the moderate antioxidant range (100-250 mg/L). Sea grapes (C.racemosa) have the potential as a natural antioxidant.&amp;#x0D;  &amp;#x0D;</abstract>

    <abstract>Caulerpa lentillifera is widely known to have pharmacological benefits based on a variety of research findings. The study aims to analyze the potential immunostimulant extract of ethanol Caulerpa lentillifera in blood profiles in vivo. The methods carried out included extraction of Caulerpa lentillifera ethanol, observation of the hematological profile of erythrocytes, leukocytes and micronucleus and phagocytosis activity in the Balb/c scavengers administered orally with a dose of 25, 50, 100, 150 mg/kg BW for one week. The results obtained that Caulerpa lentillifera ethanol extract showed a significant increase in the number of leukocytes at each treatment dose. The number of erythrocytes also increased but did not show any significance. The activity of phagocytosis also showed a significant increase with the highest percentage of the treatment dose of 100 mg/kg BW. The results of the micronuclei analysis showed no difference. Based on the results of this study showed an increase in the number of erythrocytes leukocytes as well as phagocytosis indicated the occurrence of an increased immune system. It can be concluded that Caulerpa lentillifera is also able to boost the immune system or as an immunostimulant through increased blood profile as well as phagocytosis activity in vivo.</abstract>

    <abstract>Food can fulfill both functional needs that are beneficial for health and nutritional requirements. Using mocaf (modified cassava flour) has been studied to produce food-processed products with good sensory characteristics, such as dry noodles. Latoh, which is rich in phenolic content and antioxidant activity, can further enhance the functional properties of noodles in addition to serving as a binder. Additionally, the addition of sago starch can improve the texture of the noodles and serve as a source of dietary fiber. This study aimed to study the nutritional value and functional properties of mocaf noodles by adding sago starch and latoh. There were six formula with varying percentages of mocaf flour, including sago with a ratio of 60%:10% (M1), 50%:20% (M2), 40%:30% (M3), 30%:40% (M4), 20%:40% (M5), and 10%:60% (M6), each formula containing 2% latoh flour. The result showed that mocaf noodle contained ash content about 1.32-1,32%, protein content 3.9-4.37%, fat content 0.41-0.67%, carbohydrate content 82.39-83.43% and total calories 339-343 kcal/100g noodles. Formula M3 had higher antioxidant activity (6.6%) and total dietary fiber content (11,54%) compared to other samples. The resistant starch content of noodles ranged from 8.7-12.64% with starch digestibility ranging from 27.27-61.05%. In conclusion, incorporating 30% sago starch, 40% mocaf, and 2% latoh flour in a formula has been found to increase dietary fiber and decrease starch digestibility. This suggests that the formula has the potential to be developed as a functional food.</abstract>

    <abstract>nvestigations on indigenous and non-indigenous invasive flora and fauna of a certain geographical area are always important to assess their impact on native biodiversity and control their spread by making conservation strategies to protect biodiversity. In this study, we have encountered overwhelming growth of six seaweed species, Caulerpa racemosa, C. serrulata, C. sertularioides, C. taxifolia, C. peltata, and Halimeda opuntia on the reef flat. These algal covers on reef area appear to compete with coral polyps and restrict their settlement and resilience. Our concern on invasive species distribution in Gulf of Mannar revealed these overgrowing invasive species, which can become potential threats to coral reefs, benthic diversity, and reef assemblage. These observations will help us to develop multidisciplinary management approaches related to the expansion, mitigation, and control of these opportunistic invasive species. Further seasonal monitoring on these algal species is under process to investigate their spatial shift patterns on various coral forms.</abstract>

    <title>PENGARUH EKSTRAK KASAR JAGUNG (Zea mays) SEBAGAI ZAT PENGATUR TUMBUH ALAMI TERHADAP LAJU PERTUMBUHAN Caulerpa racemosa</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Winda Rahmawati, Dicky Harwanto, Seto Windarto</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpa racemosa atau dikenal dengan nama latoh adalah salah satu komoditas perikanan yang digemari karena memiliki kandungan gizi yang tinggi. Namun, dalam budidaya C. racemosa masih terdapat kendala yaitu produksi yang belum maksimal dan pertumbuhan yang belum optimal. Salah satu cara untuk meningkatkan pertumbuhannya yaitu dengan melakukan perendaman bibit rumput laut menggunakan hormon pertumbuhan dari ekstrak bahan alami. Jagung merupakan salah satu bahan alami yang mengandung hormon pertumbuhan giberelin, sitokinin, dan auksin. Hormon tersebut dapat merangsang pertumbuhan batang dan akar. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui efektivitas penambahan hormon dengan menggunakan ekstrak kasar jagung terhadap pertumbuhan dan morfologi C. racemosa dan mengetahui lama waktu perendaman terbaik ekstrak kasar jagung terhadap pertumbuhan C. racemosa. Penelitian ini dilakukan dengan menggunakan metode eksperimen dengan Rancangan Acak Lengkap (RAL) yang terdiri dari 4 perlakuan dan 3 kali pengulangan. Perlakuan yang dilakukan yaitu perendaman selama 0 menit (sebagai kontrol) (A), 30 menit (B), 40 menit (C), dan 50 menit (D). Data yang diperoleh selama penelitian meliputi morfologi, pertumbuhan bobot mutlak, laju pertumbuhan spesifik, dan kualitas air. Lama waktu perendaman C. racemosa dalam media ekstrak kasar jagung berpengaruh nyata (P&amp;lt;0,05) terhadap pertumbuhan. Perlakuan B menunjukkan hasil terbaik terhadap pertumbuhan bobot mutlak (123,63 ± 6,55 g) dan laju pertumbuhan spesifik (4,15 ± 0,21% per hari). Perlakuan B memiliki morfologi thalus dan ramulli yang besar serta rimbun. Parameter kualitas air dalam kisaran yang sesuai untuk pertumbuhan C. racemosa.Caulerpa racemosa, known as latoh, is a popular edible green alga due to its high nutritional content and medicinal benefits. However, low quality and slow growth of seed prevented the aquaculture development C. racemosa. Soaking the seaweed seed with growth hormone immersion from extracts of natural ingredients could potentially improve its growth rate. Corn contains growth hormone gibberellins, cytokinins, and auxins. These hormones can stimulate the growth of stems and roots. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of growth hormones in corn crude extract and the best soaking time of the extract on the growth development and morphology of C. racemosa. This research was conducted using an experimental method with a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) consisting of four treatments with three replicates. The treatments were soaking the seed in corn extract for 0 minutes (as a control) (A), 30 minutes (B), 40 minutes (C), and 50 minutes (D). The data obtained during the study included morphology, absolute weight growth, specific growth rate, and water quality. The duration of immersion of C. racemosa in maize extract media had a significant effect (P&amp;lt;0.05) on growth. Treatment B showed the best results with absolute weight growth and growth rate values of 123.63 ± 6.55 g and 4.15 ± 0.21% per day, respectively. This research successfully determines that corn extract improves the growth of C. racemosa seeds indicated by the large thallus and ramuli of the cultured seaweed.</abstract>

This can happen because the sustainability of marine grape resources whose harvest still depends on nature, therefore one of the ways that needs to be done to increase income and sustainability of marine grape resources is marine grape cultivation. The goal to be achieved from this community service activity is training in sea grape cultivation (Caulerpa sp) using the quadrant net method of the bottom step system. Training activities use lecture, demonstration and discussion methods. The material presented included aquaculture technology and fishery economics for sea grape cultivation (Caulerpa sp) using the quadrant net method, the basic step-by-step system. This training activity was carried out for the coastal community in Ohoi Letman and Polikant students in the AGP and TBP Study Programs on November 05, 2022. Community service activities were carried out by the Polikant team in several stages, namely Pre-activity, Implementation of activities and Monitoring and Evaluation of activities. The training activities carried out ran smoothly and were successful and based on the evaluation results showed that there were 15 people who referred to good criteria with a value range of 76-100, 7 people who referred to sufficient criteria with a value range of 60-75 and no participants included in the criteria less with a value range &amp;lt;60. The evaluation results show that the level of public understanding of the technology and economic benefits of sea grape cultivation using the quadrant net method of the bottom step system is &amp;gt; 80%. Keywords: sea grapes; cultivation; method; income.</abstract>

    <abstract>Algal sulfated polysaccharides are known to be effective hyaluronidase inhibitors. We evaluated hyaluronidase inhibitory activity of sulfated polysaccharide (SP) fromCaulerpa lentillifera.Results showed that SP with IC50of 163 µg/mL appears to allosterically inhibit the hyaluronidase activity. Main sugar composition and sulfate content of SP was estimated to be Gal, Glc, Xyl, Man, uronic acids, and sulfate in the weight percent of 27.7: 28.9: 14.6: 22.5: 3.4: 21.7. We modified the SP by desulfation and partial hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to investigate the effect of sulfate content and molecular weight on inhibition. Hyaluronidase inhibitory activity of desulfated SP, 0.1 M TFA-hydrolyzed SP and 0.5 M TFA-hydrolyzed SP were significantly lower than that of native SP, revealing that sulfate content or molecular weight is important for hyaluronidase inhibition.</abstract>

    <title>Caulerpa cylindracea Spread on Deep Rhodolith Beds Can Be Influenced by the Morphostructural Composition of the Bed</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Sarah Caronni, Valentina Alice Bracchi, Fabrizio Atzori, Sandra Citterio, Nicoletta Cadoni, Rodolfo Gentili, Chiara Montagnani, Lara Assunta Quaglini, Daniela Basso</authors>
    <abstract>The green alga Caulerpa cylindracea Sonder (Chlorophyta; Bryopsidales) is one of the most invasive alien macroalgae in the Mediterranean Sea, where it is also spreading on rhodolith beds, an important biogenic assemblage typical of deep substrates. Despite the importance of rhodoliths, data on the competitive interactions with C. cylindracea are still scarce. To deepen the knowledge on the topic, C. cylindracea occurrence on the rhodolith bed of Capo Carbonara Marine Protected Area (Italy) was explored. Quantitative analyses of videoframes obtained from Remote Operated Vehicle records in three different MPA sites, Is Piscadeddus, Santa Caterina, and Serpentara, allow for estimates of both the cover of rhodoliths (considering the main morphotypes) and of C. cylindracea, as well as their competition. All sites showed a well-developed rhodolith bed, although some differences were highlighted in their composition in terms of morphotype, shape, and dimension of rhodoliths, as well as in the C. cylindracea cover. In particular, Santa Caterina appeared to be the site with the highest mean total cover of rhodoliths (68%), and of C. cylindracea (25%). The obtained results suggest that different competitive interactions occur between C. cylindracea and rhodolith beds, in relation to the morphostructural composition of the latter and in response to environmental conditions that affect rhodolith bed composition.</abstract>

    <authors>Tengku Said Raza’i, Viktor Amrifo, Imam Pangestiansyah Putra, Winny Retna Melani</authors>
    <abstract>Abstract                  Global climate change that occurs due to various activities carried out by humans in an effort to meet the needs of life such as conversion of residential land, industrial development, mono-culture plantations and forest burning. This condition will cause the depletion of plants as free carbon absorbers. The purpose of this study was to determine the value and productivity of the carbon stock of  C.racemosa  sea grapes as a cultivated commodity that could be superior. The results showed that  C.racemosa  had carbon reserves (ash content) of 2.98% of its body and was able to contribute carbon in nature of 32.18 kg/ha to 307.31 kg/ha based on location in Bintan and 97.78 kg/ha. ha up to 130.78 Kg/ha based on the wind season. This shows that  C. racemosa  besides being able to be used for meeting needs can also be developed as carbon stocks in the waters.</abstract>

    <abstract>Abstract                  Caulerpa macroalgae is one of the biota that has many benefits, ranging from consumption to being used as a producer of superior products. Currently, the use of Caulerpa has been widely carried out in several areas, ranging from direct use to cultivation. The distribution of Caulerpa is quite wide in shallow habitats from the intertidal zone to the edge of the edge. Caulerpa is also spread in the waters of the Seribu islands which grows in the areas of seagrass beds and coral reefs. The utilization of Caulerpa in Seribu island has not been widely carried out, so data is needed to identify the potential for Caulerpa management. dentification of species, abundance, and ecological index is needed for initial data as a basis for the management and utilization of Caulerpa in Seribu island.</abstract>

    <abstract>This study evaluated the effects of an aqueous extract of Caulerpa racemosa (AEC) on cardiometabolic syndrome markers, and the modulation of the gut microbiome in mice administered a cholesterol- and fat-enriched diet (CFED). Four groups of mice received different treatments: normal diet, CFED, and CFED added with AEC extract at 65 and 130 mg/kg body weight (BW). The effective concentration (EC50) values of AEC for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), and lipase inhibition were lower than those of the controls in vitro. In the mice model, the administration of high-dose AEC showed improved lipid and blood glucose profiles and a reduction in endothelial dysfunction markers (PRMT-1 and ADMA). Furthermore, a correlation between specific gut microbiomes and biomarkers associated with cardiometabolic diseases was also observed. In vitro studies highlighted the antioxidant properties of AEC, while in vivo data demonstrated that AEC plays a role in the management of cardiometabolic syndrome via regulation of oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial function (PRMT-1/DDAH/ADMA pathway), and gut microbiota.</abstract>

    <title>Antioxidant, and physical properties of chitosan/gelatin composite film incorporated with &lt;i&gt;Caulerpa lentillifera&lt;/i&gt; extract for pork preservation</title>
    <year>2023</year>

    <abstract>Summary  The effects of  Caulerpa lentillifera  (CL) extract incorporation on antioxidant activity, antibacterial activity, water stability, and physical properties of the chitosan/gelatin (CS/GEL) films were studied. The CL extract containing CS/GEL composite film was prepared by the casting method. The effect of CL content (1%, 3%, 5%) on the antioxidant properties, thermal property, mechanical properties, barrier properties, water stability and water contact angle of CS/GEL films was evaluated. With the increase of CL extract content, bumps and micro‐pores appeared on the surface and cross‐section of the composite films. The water contact angle, water solubility, and water absorption swelling rate of the composite films were improved with the addition of CL; therefore, the composite films exhibited better water stability. The TS of films were enhanced (from 12.57 to 23.66 MPa). Compared with the normal CS/GEL films, the CS/GEL‐CL films exhibited better antioxidant with DPPH scavenging capacity values of 72.6% and could effectively slow down the lipid oxidation of refrigerated pork samples during storage, such as lower accumulation of free fatty acid content and fluorescence compound formation. This suggested that CS/GEL‐CL film might be suitable as active films for food packaging.</abstract>

    <title>&lt;i&gt;Caulerpa lentillifera&lt;/i&gt; Seaweed Extract as Natural Sensitizer for Dye‐Sensitized Solar Cell</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Puteri Najihah Megat Zakaria, Ikhwan Syafiq Mohd Noor, Tan Winie</authors>
    <abstract>Abstract  Chlorophyll natural dye is deemed as an attractive alternative to the expensive and toxic nature Ruthenium‐based dyes, due to its abundance in nature. In this work, the chlorophyll is extracted from the  Caulerpa lentillifera  seaweed. The absorption spectrum of  C. lentillifera  shows absorbance in 400–450 and 650–700 nm. The acetone produces the highest yield for the  C. lentillifera  seaweed, followed by ethanol and methanol. The adherence of chlorophyll pigment to the surface of TiO 2  is supported by the FTIR, FESEM, and EDX analyses. Dye‐sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are fabricated with poly(vinylidene fluoride‐co‐hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF‐HFP) based gel‐like electrolyte and chlorophyll from  C. lentillifera  seaweed. The effect of the thickness of the TiO 2  mesoporous layer on the light harvesting ability of DSSCs is monitored. The highest efficiency of 0.20% is achieved with a short‐circuit current density ( J  sc ) of 0.52 mA cm −2 , the open circuit voltage ( V  oc ) of 0.58 V and the fill factor ( ff ) of 0.65. The stability of  C. lentillifera  seaweed extract in DSSCs is reported.</abstract>

    <abstract>Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui pengaruh substitusi tepung kedelai dengan tepung rumput laut Caulerpa sp.dalam pakan pakan terhadap performa pertumbuhan dan asam amino ikan bandeng (Chanos chanos). Empat jenis pakan uji dibuat yang didasarkan pada substitusi tepung kedelai (TK) dan Tepung  Caulerpa (TC) dalam pakan  : 100 % TK + 0 % TC (Pakan A), 75 % TK + 25 % TC (Pakan B), 50 % TK + 50 % TC (Pakan C) dan  25 % TK + 75 % TC (Pakan D). Sebanyak 120 ekor juvenile ikan bandeng (bobot awal rata-rata: 1,06 ± 0,12 g ) dimasukkan ke dalam 12 akuarium (10 ekor/akuarium) berukuran 35 × 34 × 40 cm yang didesain dengan sistem resirkulasi dan diisi dengan air laut yang telah difilter dengan salinitas 32 ± 1,2 ppt. Ikan bandeng diberi pakan uji sebanyak 3 kali sehari (jam 07.00, 12.00 dan 17.00 WITA) sebesar 5 % dari bobot biomassa selama  30 hari pemeliharaan. Penelitian ini didesain dengan menggunakan rancangan acak lengkap dengan mengaplikasikan 4 perlakuan dan 3 ulangan. Parameter yang diamati adalah pertumbuhan mutlak (PM), laju pertumbuhan harian (LPH), kelangsungan hidup (KH), rasio konversi pakan (RKP), efisiensi pakan (EP), konsumsi pakan (KP) dan retensi protein (RP) dan kandungan asam amino tubuh ikan. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa PM, LPH, dan RKP ikan bandeng masing-masing   berkisar antara 0,15 - 0,23 g, 0,56 – 0,83 % dan 4,34 – 9,87. Nilai EP, KP dan RP ikan bandeng masing-masing berkisar antara, 15,75 – 24,25 %,  15,90 – 16,62 g, dan 0,76 – 1,92%. Tingkat kelangsungan hidup ikan berkisar antara 70 – 83,33 %. Perubahan persentase kandungan asam amino tertinggi dalam tubuh ikan bandeng yaitu jenis asam amino lisin sebesar 97,82%. Penelitian ini menyimpulkan bahwa substitusi 50% tepung kedelai dengan tepung Caulerpa dalam pakan dapat meningkatkan pertumbuhan dan kandungan asam amino tubuh (lisin) ikan bandeng.&amp;#x0D; Kata kunci : ikan bandeng, pertumbuhan, subtitusi tepung kedelai, tepung Caulerpa sp.</abstract>

    <title>Ulvophyte Green Algae Caulerpa lentillifera: Metabolites Profile and Antioxidant, Anticancer, Anti-Obesity, and In Vitro Cytotoxicity Properties</title>

    <abstract>Marine algae have excellent bioresource properties with potential nutritional and bioactive therapeutic benefits, but studies regarding Caulerpa lentillifera are limited. This study aims to explore the metabolites profile and the antioxidant, anticancer, anti-obesity, and in vitro cytotoxicity properties of fractionated ethanolic extract of C. lentillifera using two maceration and soxhlet extraction methods. Dried simplicia of C. lentillifera was mashed and extracted in ethanol solvent, concentrated and evaporated, then sequentially partitioned with equal volumes of ethyl acetate and n-Hexane. Six samples were used in this study, consisting of ME (Maceration—Ethanol), MEA (Maceration—Ethyl Acetate), MH (Maceration—n-Hexane), SE (Soxhletation—Ethanol), SEA (Soxhletation—Ethyl Acetate), and SH (Soxhletation—n-Hexane). Non-targeted metabolomic profiling was determined using LC-HRMS, while antioxidant, anti-obesity, and anticancer cytotoxicity were determined using DPPH and ABTS, lipase inhibition, and MTT assay, respectively. This study demonstrates that C. lentillifera has several functional metabolites, antioxidant capacity (EC50 MH is very close to EC50 of Trolox), as well as anti-obesity properties (EC50 MH &amp;lt; EC50 orlistat, an inhibitor of lipid hydrolyzing enzymes), which are useful as precursors for new therapeutic approaches in improving obesity-related diseases. More interestingly, ME, MH, and SE are novel bioresource agents for anticancer drugs, especially for hepatoma, breast, colorectal, and leukemia cancers. Finally, C. lentillifera can be a nutraceutical with great therapeutic benefits.</abstract>

    <abstract>BACKGROUND: Sea grape (Caulerpa racemosa) is one of the marine plants that produce active compounds that can be used as medicinal ingredients with antifungal properties to inhibit fungal growth. AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the ethanolic extract of the ethyl acetate fraction and n-Hexane of sea grapes taken from Kampung Terih, Riau Islands could inhibit the growth of the fungus Trichophyton mentagrophytes. METHODS: The antifungal activity was tested using the paper disk diffusion method with variant concentrations of ethanol extract, namely, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, ethyl acetate and n-hexane fractions were 20,000 ppm, 30,000 ppm, 40,000 ppm, and 50,000 ppm. RESULTS: The results showed that the ethanolic extract of sea grapes could inhibit the growth of T. mentagrophytes fungus with the formation of an average diameter at each concentration of 0 mm; 3.4 mm; 5.4 mm; and 8.4 mm. The ethyl acetate fraction of Sea grapes formed an average diameter at each concentration of 9.7 mm; 11.51 mm; 13.5 mm; 15.8 mm. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the study, it was concluded that the ethanol extract and the ethyl acetate fraction of sea grapes could inhibit the fungus T. mentagrophytes with moderate inhibition, while the n-hexane fraction of sea grapes could not inhibit the fungus T. mentagrophytes.</abstract>

    <abstract>Neuromuscular disorders are a heterogeneous group of acquired or hereditary conditions that affect striated muscle function. The resulting decrease in muscle strength and motility irreversibly impacts quality of life. In addition to directly affecting skeletal muscle, pathogenesis can also arise from dysfunctional crosstalk between nerves and muscles, and may include cardiac impairment. Muscular weakness is often progressive and paralleled by continuous decline in the ability of skeletal muscle to functionally adapt and regenerate. Normally, the skeletal muscle resident stem cells, named satellite cells, ensure tissue homeostasis by providing myoblasts for growth, maintenance, repair and regeneration. We recently defined 'Satellite Cell-opathies’ as those inherited neuromuscular conditions presenting satellite cell dysfunction in muscular dystrophies and myopathies (doi:10.1016/j.yexcr.2021.112906). Here, we expand the portfolio of Satellite Cell-opathies by evaluating the potential impairment of satellite cell function across all 16 categories of neuromuscular disorders, including those with mainly neurogenic and cardiac involvement. We explore the expression dynamics of myopathogenes, genes whose mutation leads to skeletal muscle pathogenesis, using transcriptomic analysis. This revealed that 45% of myopathogenes are differentially expressed during early satellite cell activation (0-5 hours). Of these 271 myopathogenes, 83 respond to Pax7, a master regulator of satellite cells. Our analysis suggests possible perturbation of satellite cell function in many neuromuscular disorders across all categories, including those where skeletal muscle pathology is not predominant. This characterisation further aids understanding of pathomechanisms and informs on development of prognostic and diagnostic tools, and ultimately, new therapeutics.</abstract>

    <title>Population Dynamics and Ecology of Caulerpa Prolifera vs Caulerpa Taxifolia var. Distichophylla within a Levantine Gulf</title>
    <year>2022</year>
    <authors>Erhan Mutlu, Cansu Olguner, Mehmet Gökoğlu, Yaşar Özvarol</authors>
    <abstract>Sampling for two seaweeds and environmental parameters was seasonally repeated in 2011–2012 for temporal distribution of their biometrical patterns (density and plant traits) in the infralittoral of a Turkish Mediterranean gulf. Of a total of nine seaweed species found in the present study, two species were common;Caulerpa proliferaandCaulerpa taxifoliavar.distichophylla. The density and morphometrical measurements were significantly different between two common species,Caulerpa proliferaandCaulerpa taxifoliavar.distichophylla,and the measurements were found to be opposite between the two species in time and space. Asymptotic frond length (L∞) ofCaulerpa proliferaandCaulerpa taxifoliavar.distichophyllawas estimated to be 221.3 mm and 181.75 mm, whereas the annual growth rate (K) value was rather low at 0.13 and 0.11, and t0was -0.70 and -0.55 years, respectively. The environmental parameters contrasted the biometrical measurements between these two species. NH4and PO4concentrations of the near-bottom waters were positively correlated with the densities, followed by near-bottom temperature and TOC content of the sediment. There was a seasonal effect on the density variables of both species, but there was no depthwise effect. The environmental variables controlling the density variables of both species dictated the morphometrics similarly.Caulerpa taxifoliavar.distichophyllaappeared dominantly under tropical conditions (July–September) and disappeared in winter (January). The bottom depth affected slightly the morphometrics of onlyCaulerpa prolifera.</abstract>

Obesity is correlated with the consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) and monosodium glutamate (MSG). Although the effect of MSG or HFD on inflammation has been established, lack of information about the effects of both combination on simultaneous systemic and brain inflammation that can be evaluated from cortisol serum and brain resistin level respectively. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the effects of combining HFD and MSG on brain resistin, serum cortisol, lipid profiles, visceral weight, and body weight gain. Methods: Sixteen adult female rats were randomized into 4 groups consist of standard diet; HFD+MSG 0.05 mg/gBW, HFD+MSG 0.2 mg/gBW and HFD+MSG 0.35 mg/gBW. Lipid profiles were measured using automatic biochemical analyzer. Brain resistin and serum cortisol level were determined using enzyme-linked immunoassay. Results: The groups of HFD+MSG significantly have higher level of brain resistin (p&lt;0.003), serum cortisol (p&lt;0.01), total cholesterol (p&lt;0.003) and visceral fat weight (p&lt;0.05) than control group. Conclusion: The combination of HFD, and MSG generates obesity that led to systemic-brain alteration on inflammation. Further study is necessary to evaluate further the functional impact of both combinations on behavioral profiles.</abstract>

    <title>Investigating the Role of Terminal Stolon of Marine Invasive Green Macroalga Caulerpa taxifolia in the Removal of Inorganic Nitrogen from Seawater</title>
    <year>2022</year>
    <authors>Bingxin Huang, Zhan Wang, Yue Chu, Lanping Ding</authors>
    <abstract>The marine benthic green macroalga Caulerpa taxifolia is an invasive seaweed found in Europe, America, and Australia, and it forms into huge algal meadows on shallow seafloors with its stolon and rhizoid systems. It has bloomed along the coast of the South China Sea, causing serious environmental problems. However, its ecological impact has not been well studied. Therefore, this study investigated the changes in concentration of NH4-N and NO2-N in artificial seawater in which C. taxifolia was cultivated under laboratory conditions during the circadian rhythm. Results showed that concentrations of NH4-N and NO2-N decreased with the increase in culture time during the circadian rhythm. In 24 h, the NH4-N-removal efficiency increased during the light period, and the maximum reached 71.4%; that of NO2-N increased with time extension in the dark period, and the maximum reached 9.2%. The absorption of NH4-N and NO2-N by terminal stolon of C. taxifolia was different. NH4-N was absorbed more preferentially than NO2-N. However, there was no obvious correlation between NH4-N and NO2-N absorption. Therefore, the terminal stolon of C. taxifolia can be used to clean up inorganic nitrogen, and showed great application potential in the remediation of eutrophic waters as the algal-bacterial symbiotic system could facilitate NO2-N removal.</abstract>

    <abstract>Rumput laut (Caulerpa racemosa) merupakan salah satu makroalga yang memiliki kemampuan untuk mengakumulasi logam berat, sehingga dijadikan sebagai bioindikator pencemaran lingkungan. Wilayah pesisir Lamongan, termasuk di Kecamatan Brondong terdapat berbagai kegiatan industri. Buangan limbah kegiatan industri tersebut akan meningkatkan resiko pencemaran logam berat. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah observasi dengan analisis Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Analisis data yang digunakan yaitu kuantitatif dengan perhitungan berdasarkan Geo-Accumulation Index (Igeo), Contamination Factor (CF), dan Bio Concentration Factor (BCF). Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa rumput laut (C. racemosa), air, dan sedimen dari tambak tradisional di Brondong, Lamongan mengandung logam berat (Pb, Cd, dan As) dengan konsentrasi yang rendah. Rata-rata konsentrasi Pb, Cd, dan As pada rumput laut (C. racemosa) berturut-turut adalah 0,0901 mg/kg, 0,0124 mg/kg, dan 0,2357 mg/kg. Konsentrasi Pb dan Cd pada air tidak terdeteksi, sedangkan rata-rata konsentrasi As pada air adalah 0,0158 mg/l. Konsentrasi Pb, Cd, dan As pada sedimen berturut-turut adalah 12,3 mg/kg, 0,171 mg/kg, dan 3,74 mg/kg. Nilai Igeo dan CF menunjukkan bahwa logam berat (Pb, Cd, dan As) mengindikasikan tingkat pencemaran dan tingkat kontaminasi yang rendah (0&amp;lt;Igeo&amp;lt;1 dan CF&amp;lt;1). Nilai BCF yang rendah juga menunjukkan bahwa tingkat akumulatif rumput laut (C. racemosa) dikategorikan rendah (BCF&amp;lt;100). Berdasarkan hasil penelitian ini, dapat diketahui bahwa tambak tradisional di Brondong, Lamongan tergolong aman untuk dilakukan kegiatan budidaya rumput laut (C. racemosa).</abstract>

    <abstract>In this study, we report the synthesis of platinum nanoparticles (Cs-PtNPs) using an aqueous extract ofCaulerpa sertularioidesas a reducing agent. Cs-PtNPs were characterized by UV–Vis spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. Cs-PtNPs are spherical with a particle size of 6–22 nm. Cs-PtNPs have been shown to have highly effective antioxidant activities with 74% for DPPH, 63% for reducing power, and 59% for total antioxidant at 1 mg/ml, and results were compared with standardL-ascorbic acid. Furthermore, the Cs-PtNPs demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative bacteria,Vibrio parahaemolyticuswith the highest zone of inhibition (18 mm) at 50 µg/ml. Moreover,Artemianauplii showed less toxicity when treated with Cs-PtNPs at 150 µg/ml, indicating that the Cs-PtNPs are less toxic and environment friendly.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of substratum types on the growth of assimilators and stolons of &amp;lt;italic&amp;gt;Caulerpa okamurae&amp;lt;/italic&amp;gt; (Bryopsidales, Chlorophyta)</title>
    <year>2022</year>
    <authors>Seo Kyoung Park, Jang K. Kim, Han Gil Choi</authors>
    <abstract>To examine the effects of substratum types on the growth of Caulerpa okamurae, sand surface and sand burial experiments were conducted. Five assimilators (erect fronds) per replicate were cultured for 15 d on the surface of three different treatments: fine sand (200 μm), coarse sand (600 μm), and no sand (control). Also, three stolons and three assimilators were buried by fine grain or coarse grain sands and incubated for 15 d. In both experiments, other culture conditions included 25°C, 30 μmol photons m-2 s-1, and 16 : 8 h L : D (light : dark). In both experiments, stolon + assimilator-, assimilator-, and stolon-weights were measured. Relative growth rates (RGRs) of stolon + assimilator weights ranged from 0.43 to 1.95% d-1 at no sand and fine sand treatment, respectively. RGRs for the weight of stolon + assimilator and new assimilators were significantly greater on the fine- and coarse sand surface than the control. In the burial experiments, RGRs of stolons (4.28% d-1 at coarse sand and 5.57% d-1 at fine sand, respectively) were significantly greater than those of assimilators (1.38% d-1 at fine sand and 1.82% d-1 at coarse sand, respectively). When stolons were buried, RGRs for assimilators were greater at the fine sand than at the coarse sand treatment. On the other hand, RGRs of buried assimilators for total frond weights and for newly produced stolons were significantly greater at the coarse sands than at the fine sands. In conclusion, C. okamurae grew well with all substrates of sands and showed better growth on fine sands than coarse ones. This result suggests that the growth of stolons and assimilators of C. okamurae is stimulated after stable attachment to the sand substrates by rhizophores. In addition, stolons showed higher growth rates than the assimilators in the sand burial states, indicating that stolons are more tolerant to low light than assimilators of C. okamurae.</abstract>

    <title>Effects of Caulerpa taxifolia on Physiological Processes and Gene Expression of Acropora hyacinthus during Thermal Stress</title>
    <year>2022</year>
    <authors>Jian-Rong Fu, Jie Zhou, Yan-Ping Zhang, Li Liu</authors>
    <abstract>An increasing ecological phase shift from coral-dominated reefs to macroalgae-dominated reefs as a result of anthropogenic impacts, such as eutrophication, sedimentation, and overfishing, has been observed in many reef systems around the world. Ocean warming is a universal threat to both corals and macroalgae, which may alter the outcome of competition between them. Therefore, in order to explore the effects of indirect and direct exposure to macroalgae on the physiological, biochemical, and genetic expression of corals at elevated temperature, the coral Acropora hyacinthus and highly invasive green algae Caulerpa taxifolia were chosen. Physiologically, the results exhibited that, between the control and direct contact treatments, the density and chlorophyll a content of zooxanthella decreased by 53.1% and 71.2%, respectively, when the coral indirectly contacted with the algae at an ambient temperature (27 °C). Moreover, the enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in coral tissue were enhanced by interacting with algae. After an increase of 3 °C, the density and chlorophyll a content of the zooxanthella reduced by 84.4% and 93.8%, respectively, whereas the enzyme activities of SOD and CAT increased 2.3- and 3.1-fold. However, only the zooxanthellae density and pigment content decreased when Caulerpa taxifolia was co-cultured with Acropora hyacinthus at 30 °C. Molecularly, different from the control group, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) such as Rab family, ATG family, and Casp7 genes were significantly enriched in the endocytosis, autophagy, and apoptosis pathways, regardless of whether Acropora hyacinthus was directly or indirectly exposed to Caulerpa taxifolia at 27 °C. Under thermal stress without algae interaction, the DEGs were significantly enriched in the microbial immune signal transduction pathways, such as the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway, while multiple cellular immunity (IFI47, TRAF family) and oxidative stress (CAT, SODC, HSP70) genes were upregulated. Inversely, compared with corals without interaction with algae at 30 °C, the DEGs of the corals that interacted with Caulerpa taxifolia at 30 °C were remarkably enriched in apoptosis and the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, including the transcription factors such as the Casp family and TRAF family. In conclusion, the density and chlorophyll a content of zooxanthella maintained a fading tendency induced by the macroalgae at ambient temperatures. The oxidative stress and immune response levels of the coral was elevated at 30 °C, but the macroalgae alleviated the negative effects triggered by thermal stress.</abstract>

    <authors>Nazli Mert-Ozupek, Gizem Calibasi-Kocal, Nur Olgun, Yasemin Basbinar, Levent Cavas, Hulya Ellidokuz</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpa  spp. secrete more than thirty different bioactive chemicals which have already been used in cancer treatment research since they play a pivotal role in cancer metabolism. Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancer types, thus using novel and effective chemicals for colorectal cancer treatment is crucial. In the cheminformatics pipeline of this study, ADME-Tox and drug-likeness tests were performed for filtering the secondary metabolites of  Caulerpa  spp. The ligands which were selected from the ADME test were used for  in silico  molecular docking studies against the enzymes of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphoglutarate dehydrogenase), which is of great importance for colorectal cancer, by using AutoDock Vina. Pharmacophore modeling was carried out to align the molecules. Molecular dynamic simulations were performed for each target to validate the molecular docking studies and binding free energies were calculated. According to the ADME test results, 13 different secondary metabolites were selected as potential ligands. Molecular docking studies revealed that vina scores of caulerpin and monomethyl caulerpinate for G6PDH were found as −10.6 kcal mol-1, −10.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. Also, the vina score of caulersin for 6PGD was found as −10.7 kcal mol-1. The highest and the lowest binding free energies were calculated for monomethyl caulerpinate and caulersin, respectively. This  in silico  study showed that caulerpin, monomethyl caulerpinate, and caulersin could be evaluated as promising marine phytochemicals against pentose phosphate pathway enzymes and further studies are recommended to investigate the detailed activity of these secondary metabolites on these targets.</abstract>

    <title>Effects of thermal treatments on the characterisation of microencapsulated chlorophyll extract of Caulerpa racemosa</title>
    <year>2022</year>
    <authors>Eko Nurcahya Dewi, Lukita Purnamayati, Irwandi Jaswir</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpa racemosa is a macroalga that has a green pigment, that is, chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is highly sensitive to damage during heat processing. In the present work, C. racemosa chlorophyll extract was microencapsulated with fish gelatine and Arabic gum coatings, using a freeze-drying technique, to protect against heat damage. The microcapsules were subjected to high temperatures (120, 140, and 160°C) for 5 h. The protective effect of microcapsules on chlorophyll stability was assessed by measuring chlorophylls a and b degradation, total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, functional group analysis, colour, particle size, and morphology via scanning electron microscopy. Chlorophyll b significantly decreased by 87.78% in comparison with chlorophyll a (61.49%) during heating; the characteristic green colour of chlorophyll changed to brownish-green following heat exposure. However, chlorophyll was still present in the microcapsules as detected by the presence of the functional group C=O bond at 1600 nm wavelength. The heat treatment did not affect microcapsule particle size and morphology. Particle size distribution ranged from 91.58 to 112.51 µm, and the microcapsule was flake-shaped. The activation energy of chlorophyll a was 19336.96 kJ/mol·K; this was higher than that of chlorophyll b, which was 1780.53 kJ/mol·K. Based on the results, microcapsules produced using fish gelatine and Arabic gum as coating materials were able to protect chlorophyll in C. racemosa extract from heat damage.</abstract>

    <abstract>Abstract  Marine algae are found to be excellent in their nutritional and potential therapeutic properties. This study explores the antidiabetic and anticancer potential of fractionated polyphenolic extract of  Caulerpa racemosa,  green macroalgae. Crude polyphenolic extract (CPE) of  C. racemosa  and its fractions (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, and distilled water) were tested for its total phenol and flavonoid contents and antioxidant potential. The ethyl acetate fraction was subjected to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The in vitro antidiabetic activity was assessed by alpha-amylase, glucosidase inhibition and anti-glycation assays. Also, in-silico studies were conducted to test the binding affinities between caulerpin with alpha-glucosidase enzyme and estrogen receptor (ER) active sites. Each fraction was tested for its in vitroin vitroanticancer activity by CellTiter-Glo and MTT cell proliferation assays. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents and the antioxidant potential of the crude extract were observed to be dose dependent. The GC/MS analysis of the ethyl acetate fraction yielded 47 peaks, whereas n-hexadecanoic acid and hexadecanoic acid methyl ester showed the highest compatibility percentages of 99% and 96%, respectively. The CPE exhibited a higher potential in both alpha-amylase inhibitory and anti-glycation activities. The ethyl acetate fraction was more effective against alpha-glucosidase inhibition. Molecular docking revealed a high binding affinity between the alpha-glucosidase enzyme and caulerpin and showed high binding affinity toward caulerpin, with H-bond interactions. The in vitro anticancer analyses revealed that chloroform fraction and CPE exhibited moderate activity on the KAIMRC1 cell line. Also, the CPE exhibited high specificity compared to the standard drug in anticancer studies. Our findings evidence the pharmacological potential of the CPE of  C. racemosa,  and bioactive compounds of the species may be utilized as lead molecules to develop anti-diabetic and anti-cancer drugs.</abstract>

    <authors>Brigitte Gavio, Natalia Rincón-Díaz, Luis Chasqui, Mariana Luna, Monica Puyana</authors>
    <abstract>Invasive macroalgae represent a major threat to marine biodiversity and may modify the invaded habitat, displace native species, and form monospecific beds altering the tridimensional structure of the ecosystem. Several species of the genus Caulerpa are high-profile invaders, with very aggressive behavior and high expansion rates. We report, for the first time, the presence of Caulerpa scalpelliformis in Colombia, along the Caribbean coast of La Guajira peninsula. The alga was observed both on rocky shores and in seagrass beds at several locations, which indicates that the species is well established. The alga has two different growth forms, at one location, the erect fronds reached 35 cm in length, a size never reported before for the species. At the other sites, the fronds were much smaller. The population with large fronds was observed at a site where raw sewage discharge takes place. The species has shown invasive behavior in Brazil, where it has displaced the dominant native taxon Sargassum vulgare. La Guajira peninsula harbors more than 80% of the seagrass beds of Colombia, and the presence of this introduced species justifies the start of a monitoring program to determine its effect on the ecosystem.</abstract>

    <abstract>Introduction:  Cervical cancer is caused by persistent infections of human papillomavirus types 16 and 18. Also, it is classified as a malignancy since it is able to spread itself to other sites and form a metastasis. Lymph nodes metastasis is an important factor related to cervical cancer survival. The previous study reported that  Caulerpa racemosa  has an anti-cancer effect by inducing apoptosis by inhibiting p53 protein degradation in HeLa cancer cells. In this study, we conducted a follow-up test to determine the anticancer effect of  Caulerpa racemosa  as an antimetastatic agent on HeLa cancer cells.   Methods:  A true experimental study with a post-test-controlled group design was carried out on four groups of HeLa cell cultures by presenting different concentrations of  Caulerpa racemosa  extract. Moreover, to identify the antimetastatic effect, HeLa cells treated with  Caulerpa racemosa  extract were subjected to the woud healing scratch test and immunofluorescence staining assays. Data analysis was gained with qualitative and quantitative approaches. Quantitative methods such as One-way analysis of variance, Tukey’s multiple comparison test, and Pearson’s correlation were conducted.   Result:  We found that  Caulerpa racemosa  significantly inhibit HeLa cells wound healing migration. We also demonstrated the effect of  Caulerpa racemosa  in downregulating Snail and Vimentin protein expression and upregulating E-Cadherin protein expression.   Conclusion:  Caulerpa racemosa  extract inhibits HeLa cancer cells migration by altering important regulator proteins expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathways.</abstract>

    <title>Preparation, Characterization, and Anti-Adhesive Activity of Sulfate Polysaccharide from Caulerpa lentillifera against Helicobacter pylori</title>
    <year>2022</year>
    <authors>Bao Le, Duy Thanh Do, Hien Minh Nguyen, Bich Hang Do, Huong Thuy Le</authors>
    <abstract>In the gastric mucosa, chronic inflammation due to Helicobacter pylori infection promotes gastrocarcinogenesis. Polysaccharides of Caulerpa lentillifera are well-characterized by broad antimicrobial activity and anti-inflammatory potentials. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether the low molecular sulfate polysaccharides of C. lentillifera (CLCP) exhibit any anti-adhesive activity against H. pylori. After a hot water extraction and purification process, two purified polysaccharide fractions (CLCP-1 and CLCP2) were studied based on structural characterization and bioactivity determination. The results implied that except for the molar ratio, CLCP-1 and CLCP-2 contain high sulfate, mannose, galactose, xylose, glucose levels, and low protein levels. The molecular weight and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) assays confirmed that CLCP-1 and CLCP-2 are sulfate polysaccharides with an average molecular weight (Mw) of 963.15 and 648.42 kDa, respectively. In addition, CLCP-1 and CLCP-2 exhibited stronger antibacterial activity against H. pylori. CLCP-1 and CLCP-2 could significantly promote macrophage proliferation and decrease the production of nitric oxide (NO) through downregulated expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Meanwhile, CLCP-1 and CLCP-2 in this study showed efficiently protected gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells against H. pylori with the inhibition of the IL-8/NF-κB axis. These findings suggested the effect of Caulerpa lentillifera polysaccharides on H. pylori adhesion, a potential supply of nutrients for eradication therapy through the reduction of cell count and inflammation.</abstract>

    <abstract>Abstract   BACKGROUND   Caulerpa lentillifera  has received extensive attention regarding expansion of its farming and increasing consumption. In our previous study, the structure of  C. lentillifera  polysaccharide (CLP) was elucidated. However, little information is available about its health effects. In this study, the anti‐obesity effect of CLP was investigated by using a high‐fat diet‐induced obese mice model with two different supplementation methods.    RESULTS   In vitro  simulated digestion results showed that CLP significantly decreased the lipid digestibility and induced the lipid droplets aggregation in the intestinal stage to inhibit the absorption of lipids. As revealed by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and non‐targeted metabolomics, supplement of CLP by both pre‐prandial gavage and free feeding patterns effectively prevented mice obesity via ameliorating intestinal flora disturbance and regulating bile acids circulation metabolism. Of note was that CLP administration had no effect on short‐chain fatty acids production, suggesting the anti‐obesity effect was uncorrelated with their production. Moreover, pre‐prandial administration of CLP had a better anti‐obesity effect in lowering body weight and serum lipid levels, but the free feeding resulted in a higher  α ‐diversity of gut microbiota.    CONCLUSION  The findings of this study indicate that CLP could be a potential anti‐obesity nutraceutical and that pre‐prandial supplement of CLP may be a better intake method to exhibit its hypolipidemic effect. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.</abstract>

    <abstract>Caulerpa is a green macroalgae found on Lemukutan Island, West Kalimantan. Caulerpa contains bioactive compounds that have potential to inhibit the alpha-glucosidase enzyme for people with diabetes mellitus. Inhibition of the alpha-glucosidase enzyme will have an impact on delaying glucose absorption. In addition, it is necessary to carry out a toxicity test to detect toxic effects and assess safety in the use of compounds. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the inhibitory activity of the alpha-glucosidase enzyme and the toxicity of the ethanolic extract of Caulerpa seaweed in Lemukutan Island waters. Identification of secondary metabolites was determined from phytochemical tests. Inhibitory activity of the alpha-glucosidase enzyme determined by using enzymatic reactions, while the toxicity by method of BSLT. The showed that the percentage yield of Caulerpa ethanol extract was 3.66%. The content of bioactive compounds in the ethanolic extract of Caulerpa contains positive alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, steroids, and phenolics. The inhibitory of the alpha-glucosidase enzyme had the highest percentage of inhibition with a concentration of 300 ppm indicating a percent inhibition of 16.85%. Toxicity obtained LC50 value of 598.19 ppm which is classified as low toxic.</abstract>

    <title>Optimized Alternating Current Electric Field and Light Irradiance for Caulerpa lentillifera Biomass Sustainability—An Innovative Approach for Potential Postharvest Applications</title>
    <year>2022</year>
    <authors>Andi Syahrullah Sulaimana, Bara Yudhistira, Chao-Kai Chang, Mohsen Gavahian, Cheng-Chia Yu, Chih-Yao Hou, Chang-Wei Hsieh</authors>
    <abstract>Recently published preliminary data proposed alternating current electric field (ACEF) as a promising technique for the postharvest storage of seagrape (Caulerpa lentillifera). The current study suggested a combination of storage light irradiance (SLI) and ACEF (intensity and time) to enhance seagrape physicochemical quality (PQ). It utilized Taguchi orthogonal array design (OAD) to optimize the processing conditions. Results showed all the processing parameters had significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05) effects on seagrape PQ. This study found that 50 kV/m for 60 min (ACEF) and 9 mol photons m−2 s−1 performed the best inhibition on seagrape PQ deterioration. It revealed that adjusting the processing parameters in the range explored in this study (50, 125, 200 kV/m of ACEF intensity; 30, 60, 90 min of ACEF treatment time; 2, 9, 16 mol photons m−2 s−1 of SLI) can reduce up to 60% of total voltage usage compared to the previous study. With a sufficient SLI and an intermediate treatment time, the finest seagrape PQ can be sustained with a lower electric strength. Therefore, this method can benefit seagrape industries and contribute to realizing sustainable development goals by strengthening resource efficiency and lowering energy consumption.</abstract>

    <abstract>Neuromuscular disorders are a heterogeneous group of acquired or hereditary conditions that affect striated muscle function. The resulting decrease in muscle strength and motility irreversibly impacts quality of life. In addition to directly affecting skeletal muscle, pathogenesis can also arise from dysfunctional crosstalk between nerves and muscles, and may include cardiac impairment. Muscular weakness is often progressive and paralleled by continuous decline in the ability of skeletal muscle to functionally adapt and regenerate. Normally, the skeletal muscle resident stem cells, named satellite cells, ensure tissue homeostasis by providing myoblasts for growth, maintenance, repair and regeneration. We recently defined 'Satellite Cell-opathies’ as those inherited neuromuscular conditions presenting satellite cell dysfunction in muscular dystrophies and myopathies (doi:10.1016/j.yexcr.2021.112906). Here, we expand the portfolio of Satellite Cell-opathies by evaluating the potential impairment of satellite cell function across all 16 categories of neuromuscular disorders, including those with mainly neurogenic and cardiac involvement. We explore the expression dynamics of myopathogenes, genes whose mutation leads to skeletal muscle pathogenesis, using transcriptomic analysis. This revealed that 45% of myopathogenes are differentially expressed during early satellite cell activation (0-5 hours). Of these 271 myopathogenes, 83 respond to Pax7, a master regulator of satellite cells. Our analysis suggests possible perturbation of satellite cell function in many neuromuscular disorders across all categories, including those where skeletal muscle pathology is not predominant. This characterisation further aids understanding of pathomechanisms and informs on development of prognostic and diagnostic tools, and ultimately, new therapeutics.</abstract>

    <abstract>Caulerpaceae are unconventional green algae composed of multinucleated, single siphonous cells. The species of Caulerpa are acquiring major scientific interest for both their invasion in the Mediterranean ecological niche and for the production of valuable natural metabolites. Furthermore, the abilities of Caulerpa spp. in the biorecovery of polluted waters were recently investigated. Among heavy metal contaminants in marine systems, zinc (Zn) is considered a critical pollutant, progressively accumulating from plastic leachates. In this study, the responses of Caulerpa racemosa to different levels (5–10 mg L−1) of Zn were studied for 14 days under laboratory-controlled conditions. Effects of Zn were monitored by measuring the growth rate, photosynthetic efficiency and gene expression. Moreover, the ability of Caulerpa to remove Zn from seawater was monitored. Zn induced detrimental effects by decreasing the relative growth rate (RGR) and maximal PSII photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm). Moreover, C. racemosa, grown in contaminated seawater, reduced the levels of Zn to a final concentration of 1.026 and 1.932 mg L−1 after 14 days, thus demonstrating efficient uptake. Therefore, our results characterized the effects of zinc on C. racemosa and the possible role of this alga as being effective in the bioremediation of marine seawater.</abstract>

    <authors>Bingxue Zhou, Audrey D. Nguyễn, Jinyang Shen, Yi Wu</authors>
    <abstract>Abstract    The immune enhancement effects of  Caulerpa lentillifera  polysaccharides (CLP) in vitro and in vivo were observed in this study. The results of the in vitro experiments show that CLP extract can promote the activation and maturation of dendritic cells and enhance the expression of IL‐6, TNF‐α, CD80, CD86, and MHC II. Expression of IL‐6 and TNF‐α was determined with ELISA kits, CD80 and CD86 were measured by flow cytometry, and MHC II was analyzed with a laser scanning confocal microscope. Changes in dendritic cell morphology and volume were also studied. The in vivo experiment shows that CLP can promote the secretion of IL‐6, INF‐γ, IgA, and IgG and enhance humoral and cellular immunity in mice. CLP extract's ability to upregulate immunity in vitro and in vivo makes it worthy of further investigation as an effective natural immunopotentiator.    Novelty impact statement         Caulerpa lentillifera  polysaccharides could enhance immunity in vitro and in vivo.       C. lentillifera  polysaccharides will be worthy to investigate to an natural immunopotentiator.</abstract>

    <title>Clionasterol-Rich Fraction of Caulerpa racemosa against Particulate Matter-Induced Skin Damage via Inhibition of Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis-Related Signaling Pathway</title>

    <abstract>The increasing airborne particulate matter (PM) consisting of environmental contaminants such as dust, aerosols, and fibers has become a global concern by causing oxidative stress that leads to apoptosis and skin damage. The current study evaluated the protective effect of Caulerpa racemosa (CR) against PM-induced skin damage using human keratinocytes and a zebrafish model. The clionasterol-rich hexane fraction (CRHF2) of CR exhibited superior protective activity through downregulating intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and mitochondrial ROS levels, as well as the PM-induced increase in apoptotic body formation and upregulation of apoptotic signaling pathway proteins, along with sub-G1 cell accumulation dose-dependently. Furthermore, in vivo results showed that CRHF2 potentially downregulates PM-induced cell death, ROS, and NO production in the zebrafish model. Hence, the results evidenced that the protective effect of CRHF2 is caused by inhibiting oxidative stress and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in cells. Therefore, C. racemosa has the potential to be used in the development of pharmaceuticals to attenuate PM-induced skin diseases.</abstract>

    <abstract>Caulerpa lentillifera (phylum: Chlorophyta) is a seaweed that is widely consumed by local communities across Asia. The effects of different oven-dried temperatures on the drying kinetics and phytochemical constituents of C. lentillifera were studied. This kinetic study used three different thin-layer models, i.e., Lewis, Henderson and Pabis, and Logarithmic models. Among these, the Logarithmic model was the most suitable model that could be determined the seaweed drying behaviours (R-square &amp;gt; 0.9923, RMSE &amp;lt; 0.0004). Drying the C. lentillifera at 50oC resulted in a higher extraction yield (1.00%) with a significant concentration of total phenolic content and total flavonoid content at 1.027 mg GAE/g, and 59.655 mg RU/g, respectively.</abstract>

    <title>GROWTH AND QUALITY OF SEA GRAPES (Caulerpa lentilifera) BY SOAKING LIQUID ORGANIC FERTILIZER IN CONTROLLED MEDIA</title>
    <year>2022</year>
    <authors>Kartina Rina</authors>
    <abstract>Caulerpa lentillifera or known as sea grape is one type of grass that has the potential to be developed. This seaweed is very popular because it has a very important economic value, namely as a fresh food ingredient and an ingredient for medicines. Efforts to increase the production of C. lentillifera can be done through engineering with the addition of fertilizers in its cultivation. The purpose of this study was to determine the dose of liquid organic fertilizer that could provide the best growth for C. lentillifera. This study used an experimental method with a completely randomized design (CRD). The treatments consisted of soaking liquid organic fertilizer (POC) with doses of P0 (0 ml/L), P1 (1.5 ml/L), P2 (2.5 ml/L) and P3 (3.5 ml/L), and made 3 repetitions. The data obtained were analyzed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Based on the results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) it was found that the application of liquid organic fertilizer had a significantly different effect on the specific growth rate and dry weight of C. lentilifera. The best dose was shown in the 1.5 ml/L fertilizer immersion treatment (P1), with a specific growth rate value of 3.27% and a dry weight value of 1.70 g which were significantly different from other treatments (P 0.05). In terms of quality, C. lentilifera soaked in 1.5 ml/L (P1) liquid fertilizer, produced a fairly high protein content of 19.05%. Water quality data including temperature, pH, and DO showed a value that was still tolerable for the growth of C. lenitilifera seaweed. Water quality measurements in this study included temperatures ranging from 26 -28 ºC, salinity ranging from 31-35ºC, pH ranging from 6.83 -7.05, while DO ranged from 5.98 - 6.90 mgL1.</abstract>

    <title>DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF GREEN SEAWEED Caulerpa (Chlorophyta) ACROSS INDONESIAN COASTAL WATERS WITH DIFFERENT NUTRIENT LEVELS: Bintan Island, Jepara, and Osi Island</title>
    <year>2022</year>
    <authors>Muhamad Darmawan, Neviaty Putri Zamani, Hari Eko Irianto, Hawis H. Madduppa</authors>
    <abstract>The green seaweed Caulerpa can be found in almost every coastal area of Indonesia, and it is one of the seaweeds with immense potential to be developed in the future. The chemical factors, especially water nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, and ammonia), play an essential role in the distribution and diversity of seaweed. This study aimed to identify the abundance, ecological index, and relationship between the water column nutrients concentration and the biodiversity of Caulerpa from three different locations (Bintan Island, Jepara, and Osi Island). There were 12 points of observation at each site. The result showed a correlation between the nutrient levels and the abundance and diversity of Caulerpa in three locations. The nitrate, ammonia, and DIN:P ratio values were significantly different between areas. In contrast, there were insignificant differences in nitrite and phosphate concentrations between sites. The highest nitrate and phosphate concentrations were observed on Osi Island. The nitrite and ammonia values were identical for the condition on Bintan Island. The nitrate value was the main characteristic that distinguished the water nutrient at all sites. The Caulerpa species found in this research were Caulerpa racemosa, Caulerpa lentilifera, Caulerpa serrulata, Caulerpa sertularoides, and Caulerpa cupresoides. The nitrate and phosphate values influenced the growth factor of the green seaweed Caulerpa lentilifera. Caulerpa racemosa and Caulerpa serrulata, on the other hand, grew in response to ammonia levels. Caulerpa cupresoides diversity and abundance were impacted by the nitrite value. The results of the canonical correspondence analysis revealed that nitrate, phosphate, and ammonia were the most important factors influencing Caulerpa distribution in three locations.</abstract>

    <abstract>The main cause of cervical cancer is infection with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Loss of apoptotic control allows cancer cells to survive longer and allows time for mutation accumulation thereby increasing the ability to invade during tumor development. Treatment options for cervical cancer today are surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Toxicity to normal cells, adverse side effects, and drug resistance are the main barriers to the use of chemotherapy. Among marine organisms such as bacteria, fungi, actinobacteria, and seaweed have been used for the treatment of cancer.  Caulerpa  has bioactive metabolites, namely alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, steroids and tannins and its bioactivity has been reported against many diseases including cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the anticancer activity of  C. racemosa  on  HeLa  cervical cancer cells. The study used a true experimental post-test only control group design to determine the effect of  C. racemosa  extract on  HeLa  cancer cells.  C. racemosa  extract was given in doses of 50 μg/mL, 100 μg/mL, 200 μg/mL, and 0 μg/mL as controls. Quantitative measurement of apoptosis was measured using flowcytometry and the expression of Bcl-2, BAX, and cleaved-caspase 3 as pro and anti-apoptotic proteins was measured using immunofluorescence. Trypan blue exclusion test was performed to measure cell viability.  C. racemosa  extract significantly increased the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and cleaved caspase-3 compared to controls. Annexin V-PI analysis showed the induction of apoptosis in treated cells and decreased  HeLa  cell viability at 24 hours and 48 hours post-treatment (p-value &amp;amp;lt;0.05).  C. racemosa  extract has potential as an anti-cancer with pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative activity on  HeLa  cancer cells and can be explored further as a cervical cancer therapy.</abstract>

    <title>Amelioration of obesity-related metabolic disorders via supplementation of Caulerpa lentillifera in rats fed with a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet</title>

    <abstract>Dietary modification, including functional foods, could reduce comorbidities due to obesity. An increase in serum glucose and lipids is often seen in obesity. Furthermore, obesity is also characterized by a decrease in antioxidant capacity (i.e., decrease in superoxide dismutase/SOD) and downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). It has been well established that PGC-1α is important to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. Sea grapes ( Caulerpa lentillifera ) are known as a traditional food in many Asia-Pacific countries. Recent evidence suggests that sea grapes have many beneficial properties as functional foods and may have potential therapeutic functions. We investigated the effect of sea grapes ( C. lentillifera ) on serum glucose, lipids, PGC-1α, and protein levels of SOD in the liver of  Rattus norvegicus , which is induced with a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet. A total of four groups were made, each containing ten male  Rattus norvegicus ; group A received a standard dry pellet diet as control, group B received cholesterol- and fat-enriched diets (CFED), groups C and D received CFED and 150 and 450 mg/kg body weight (BW) of sea grape extract, respectively, for 4 weeks. Serum glucose and cholesterol were assessed using a blood auto-analyzer. Serum PGC-1α was measured using ELISA. SOD levels were calculated using the superoxide dismutase assay kit by Sigma-Aldrich with blood taken from liver tissue. In this study, sea grape extracts improved total cholesterol levels better than the CFED and normal groups. The efficacy of total cholesterol improvement was similar between the two doses of sea grape extract. Furthermore, sea grape extract increased PCG-1α levels, especially with the dose of 150 mg/kg BW. Blood glucose was also lower in the groups of sea grape extract. Interestingly, the groups treated with sea grapes extract exhibited higher levels of liver SOD compared to the normal and CFED groups. To conclude, sea grapes ( C. lentillifera ) have promising potential for anti-hyperglycemia and anti-hypercholesterolemia, and for reducing oxidative stress, and providing various health benefits for metabolic disorders.</abstract>

    <abstract>Caulerpa lentillifera is a type of green seaweed widely consumed as a fresh vegetable, specifically in Southeast Asia. Interestingly, this green seaweed has recently gained popularity in the food sector. Over the last two decades, many studies have reported that C. lentillifera is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, minerals, vitamins, and bioactive compounds that contribute many health benefits. On the other hand, there is currently hardly any article dedicated specifically to C. lentillifera regarding nutritional composition and recent advancements in its potential health benefits. Hence, this study will summarise the findings on the nutritional content of C. lentillifera and compile recently discovered beneficial properties throughout the past decade. From the data compiled in this review paper, it can be concluded that the nutrient and phytochemical profile of C. lentillifera differs from one region to another depending on various external factors. As a result, this paper will offer researchers the groundwork to develop food products based on C. lentillifera. The authors of this paper are hopeful that a more systematic review could be done in the future as currently, existing data is still scarce.</abstract>

    <title>Ekstraksi Garam Dari Rumput Laut Caulerpa Lentilifera Dengan Kombinasi Perlakuan Agitasi dan Non Agitasi Pada Suhu Yang Berbeda</title>
    <year>2022</year>
    <authors>Ester Ruly Nomleni, Krisman Umbu Henggu, Firat Meiyasa</authors>
    <abstract>Rumput laut Caulerpa lentilifera merupakan salah satu tumbuhan air yang bermanfaat untuk kehidupan manusia. Hal ini karena rumput laut memiliki kandungan gizi terutama serat pangan hingga kandungan mineral makro dan mikro yang cukup tinggi. Kandungan mineral makro dan mikro tersebut dapat dimanfaatkan sebagai garam fungsional. Metode ekstraksi garam rumput laut Caulerpa lentilifera yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah perlakuan agitasi dan non agitasi pada suhu ekstraksi 70°C, 90°C dan 120°C. Ekstrak garam rumput laut yang dihasilkan lalu dianalisis kandungan natrium, kalium, rasio natrium-kalium (Na/K), Natrium-Klorida (NaCl), organoleptik dan rendemen. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa perbedaan metode ekstraksi (agitasi dan non agitasi) pada suhu ekstraksi yang berbeda (70°C, 90°C, 120°C) memberikan pengaruh terhadap kandungan kalium. Namun metode tersebut tidak turut memberikan pengaruh signifikan terhadap kandungan natrium. Kandungan natrium, kalium, dan Na:K terpilih berada pada perlakuan agitasi pada 120°C dengan rata-rata kandungan natrium sebesar 16,37 mg/kg, kalium 18,45 mg/kg, rasio Na:K 1,53 mg/kg. Sedangkan kandungan NaCl yang terkandung dalam ekstrak garam rumput laut berkisar antara 42,32-55,90 mg/kg. Penerimaan panelis (rasa, warna, aroma, tekstur) terhadap produk ekstrak garam rumput laut yang dihasilkan ialah memberikan kesan agak suka hingga sangat suka terutama pada rasa, aroma dan warna. Tingkat kesukaan tersebut terletak pada rasa asin (spesifik garam) dan terdapat sedikit rasa umami. Total rendemen ekstrak garam rumput laut Caulerpa lentilifera tertinggi diperoleh pada perlakuan agitasi dengan rata-rata rendemen mencapai 2,97%, sedangkan non agitasi hanya berkisar 1,41%.  Caulerpa lentilifera seaweed is one of the aquatic plants that is useful for human life. This is because seaweed has a high nutritional content, especially dietary fiber, due to the high content of macro and micro minerals. The macro and micro-mineral content can be used as functional salts. The salt extraction method of Caulerpa lentilifera seaweed used in this study was agitated and non-agitated at extraction temperatures of 70 °C, 90 °C, and 120 °C. The resulting seaweed salt extract was then analyzed for the content of sodium, potassium, sodium-potassium ratio (Na/K), sodium-chloride (NaCl), organoleptic and yield. The results showed that the different extraction methods (agitated and non-agitated) at different extraction temperatures (70 °C, 90 °C, and 120 °C) had an effect on the potassium content. However, this method did not have a significant effect on the sodium content. The selected sodium, potassium, and Na:K content were in agitation treatment at 120°C with an average sodium content of 16.37 mg/kg, potassium 18.45 mg/kg, Na:K ratio 1.53 mg/kg . While the NaCl content contained in the seaweed salt extract ranged from 42.32-55.90 mg/kg. The panelists' acceptance (taste, color, flavour, texture) of the resulting seaweed salt extract product was to give the impression of being somewhat like to really liking it, especially on taste, flavor, and color. The level of preference lies in the salty taste (specifically salt), and there is a slight umami taste. The highest total yield of Caulerpa lentilifera seaweed salt extract was obtained in the agitation treatment, with the average yield reaching 2.97%, while the non-agitated was only 1.41%.</abstract>

    <abstract>Neuromuscular disorders are a heterogeneous group of acquired or hereditary conditions that affect striated muscle function. The resulting decrease in muscle strength and motility irreversibly impacts quality of life. In addition to directly affecting skeletal muscle, pathogenesis can also arise from dysfunctional crosstalk between nerves and muscles, and may include cardiac impairment. Muscular weakness is often progressive and paralleled by continuous decline in the ability of skeletal muscle to functionally adapt and regenerate. Normally, the skeletal muscle resident stem cells, named satellite cells, ensure tissue homeostasis by providing myoblasts for growth, maintenance, repair and regeneration. We recently defined 'Satellite Cell-opathies’ as those inherited neuromuscular conditions presenting satellite cell dysfunction in muscular dystrophies and myopathies (doi:10.1016/j.yexcr.2021.112906). Here, we expand the portfolio of Satellite Cell-opathies by evaluating the potential impairment of satellite cell function across all 16 categories of neuromuscular disorders, including those with mainly neurogenic and cardiac involvement. We explore the expression dynamics of myopathogenes, genes whose mutation leads to skeletal muscle pathogenesis, using transcriptomic analysis. This revealed that 45% of myopathogenes are differentially expressed during early satellite cell activation (0-5 hours). Of these 271 myopathogenes, 83 respond to Pax7, a master regulator of satellite cells. Our analysis suggests possible perturbation of satellite cell function in many neuromuscular disorders across all categories, including those where skeletal muscle pathology is not predominant. This characterisation further aids understanding of pathomechanisms and informs on development of prognostic and diagnostic tools, and ultimately, new therapeutics.</abstract>

    <title>Caulerpa chemnitzia in Darwin threatening Galapagos coral reefs</title>
    <year>2022</year>
    <authors>Inti Keith, William Bensted-Smith, Stuart Banks, Jenifer Suarez, Bernhard Riegl</authors>
    <abstract>Coral reefs are rare in the Galapagos and there is concern that, like in many areas around the world, they may be degrading due to increasing anthropogenic pressure, which can cause changes and reorganizations of structure and function with associated phase shifts. Algae of the genus  Caulerpa  J.V. Lamouroux, 1809 are known as widespread and persistent marine invaders. They grow rapidly, particularly in disturbed areas where they can opportunistically monopolize substratum and compete with native species, thus reducing biodiversity.  Caulerpa chemnitzia  increased in abundance and overgrew corals on the reef since 2012, ultimately raising fears that a phase-shift from coral to algae might be imminent. However, from 2019 onwards algae populations strongly contracted and while not having returned to baseline level, there is currently low risk of corals being displaced. Visual censuses were conducted on a yearly basis since 2004 using sample quadrats (0.5 x 0.5m) every 5 m along a 50-m-long transects at a depth of 6–15 m at 5 permanent subtidal ecological monitoring sites around Darwin. In addition, 10 m photo-transects were taken using a graduated meter-long measuring stick in the centre of the frame in 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2021 at a depth of 15m at Wellington reef. The authors hypothesize that this species could have expanded its distribution over Wellington Reef because of its known morphological plasticity due to a response to change in the environment, in this case high temperature and low nutrients. As ENSO events are predicted to increase in intensity and frequency due to the impact of climate change it is important to develop and implement a functional alert system. Early Detection Rapid Response (EDRR) protocols are recommended to avoid climate driven Non-Indigenous Species (NIS) entering the GMR or for native species becoming invasive due to warming-related phase shifts.</abstract>

    <abstract>The studies of the Bulung Boni and Bulung Anggur (Caulerpa spp.) species and secondary metabolites are still very limited. Proper identification will support various aspects, such as cultivation, utilization, and economic interests. Moreover, understanding the secondary metabolites will assist in developing algae-based products. This study aimed to identify these indigenous Caulerpa algae and analyze their bioactive components. The tufA sequence was employed as a molecular marker in DNA barcoding, and its bioactive components were identified using the GC-MS method. The phylogenetic tree was generated in MEGA 11 using the maximum likelihood method, and the robustness of the tree was evaluated using bootstrapping with 1000 replicates. This study revealed that Bulung Boni is strongly connected to Caulerpa cylindracea. However, Bulung Anggur shows no close relationship to other Caulerpa species. GC-MS analysis of ethanolic extracts of Bulung Boni and Bulung Anggur showed the presence of 11 and 13 compounds, respectively. The majority of the compounds found in these algae have been shown to possess biological properties, such as antioxidant, antibacterial, anticancer, anti-inflammation, and antidiabetic. Further study is necessary to compare the data obtained using different molecular markers in DNA barcoding, and to elucidate other undisclosed compounds in these Caulerpa algae.</abstract>

    <title>Sulfated Glucan from the Green Seaweed Caulerpa sertularioides Inhibits Adipogenesis through Suppression of Adipogenic and Lipogenic Key Factors</title>
    <year>2022</year>
    <authors>Gildacio Chaves Filho, Lucas Batista, Silvia de Medeiros, Hugo Rocha, Susana Moreira</authors>
    <abstract>Sulfated polysaccharides (SPS) from seaweeds have great biochemical and biotechnological potential. This study aimed to investigate the effect of SPS isolated from the seaweed Caulerpa sertularioides on adipogenic differentiation as a possible alternative treatment for obesity. The SPS-rich extract from the seaweed C. sertularioides was fractioned into three SPS-rich fractions (F0.5; F0.9; and F1.8) chemically characterized. Among these four samples, only F0.9 showed a significant inhibitory effect on adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Ten SPS-rich fractions were isolated from F0.9 through ion-exchange chromatography. However, only the fraction (CS0.2) containing a sulfated glucan was able to inhibit adipogenesis. CS0.2 reduces lipid accumulation and inhibits the expression of key adipogenic (PPARγ, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPα) and lipogenic markers (SREBP-1c, Fabp4, and CD36). The data points to the potential of sulfated glucan from C. sertularioides for the development of functional approaches in obesity management.</abstract>

    <title>Tracking Iodine Decrease in Commercially Sold Caulerpa racemosa (Forsskål) J. Agardh (Chlorophyta, Ulvophyceae) during Storage</title>
    <year>2022</year>
    <authors>Kathleen Amor Berones, Leni Yap-Dejeto</authors>
    <abstract>Iodine is known as an essential mineral for thyroid hormone production in humans. It is water- soluble and diffuses into the atmosphere, where it is thought to break ozone molecules. Caulerpa racemosa (Phylum Chlorophyta, Class Ulvophyceae, Order Bropsidales) is a common dietary seaweed believed to be a good source of iodine in the Philippines. As of this writing, there is no record of iodine concentration measurements in harvested C. racemosa from Philippine waters. There is an expected decrease in iodine concentrations from harvested C. racemosa through time. But how fast it decreases and how much of it remains in the seaweed if stored for days is also unknown. This study measured iodine concentration in C. racemosa samples from an area in the Philippines and calculated the daily changes in iodine level concentrations of harvested C. racemosa that were stored. Titration analyses were done every 24 h, with factors such as the algal age, temperature, light, among others, kept constant. Storage conditions were adapted from how local vendors store leftover seaweed merchandise. Results revealed a decrease in iodine levels over time (y = –20.438x + 228.99; R² = 0.8937). The initial concentration (at dry weight) of iodine measured was 196 ppm and dropped to 94.8 ppm on the seventh day. Iodine levels of freshly picked and stored C. racemosa were also compared with the recommended daily iodine intake for humans.</abstract>

    <abstract>Obesity is associated with an accelerated aging process, which prevents healthy aging. Both obesity and aging were manifested in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator α (PGC-1α) level. These studies fulfill the scientific gap in assembled pharmacological activity assay of  Caulerpa racemosa  done in a previous preclinical trial. Six major compounds from sea grape ( C. racemosa ) extract were evaluated using an  in silico  approach against human pancreatic  lipase ,  a-glucosidase , and  a-amylase  to predict prospective anti-obesity candidates. The  lipase  inhibitory activity of the extract reached 90.30 ± 0.40%, 1.75% lower than orlistat. The  a-amylase  inhibitory assay of the extract was 84.07 ± 5.28%, while the inhibitory activity against  a-glucosidase  was 81.67 ± 1.54%; both were lower than acarbose. We observe the effect of  C. racemosa  extract as anti-obesity with anti-aging by evaluating the obesity parameters in the human body for a 4-week period. There was a significant decrease in blood glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG), waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, and body weight ( p  &amp;amp;lt; 0.05); PGC-1α and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) increased significantly ( p  = 0.000), in Group B when compared with Group A. Our study revealed that sea grape extract is a potent anti-obesity with an anti-aging reagent that does not produce any significant adverse effects.</abstract>

    <authors>Quanh Thi Minh Thu, Dang Vu Luong, Do Thi Thanh Xuan, Thanh Thi Thu Thuy</authors>
    <abstract>In this work, hot water extraction was applied to isolate a polysaccharide from green seaweed Caulerpa torta, the extraction yield was 3.4% of dried seaweed weight. The structural characteristics and cytotoxic effects on three human cancer cell lines of the polysaccharide were investigated. The results showed that the polysaccharide consisted of galactose, glucose, xylose and mannose in a molar ratio of 1.00: 0.74: 0.21: 0.0.21, with a molecular weight of 107 kDa. In addition, it contained sulfate groups, which is approximately 15.34%w. The polysaccharide showed a significant cytotoxic activity against thyroid cancer - 8505C (IC50 55.55±1.84 µg/ml), colon cancer - HT-29 (IC50 57.26±2.06 µg/ml) and cervical cancer - Hela (IC50 54.79 ±3.22 µg/ml).</abstract>

    <title>Biological potential and bio-refinery from marine macro algae Caulerpa scalpelliformis</title>
    <year>2022</year>
    <authors>Palaniappan Seedevi</authors>
    <abstract>The present investigation evaluated the toxic effect and bioactive potential of marine macro algaeCaulerpa scalpelliformis. The crude methanolic extract was fractionated in diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose column chromatography using NaCl (0.1–10 M). The fractions were dialyzed and freeze-dried. The active fractions (F1, F2, and F3) were obtained using TLC chromatography. The crude methanolic extract and fractions showed strong hemolytic activity of 129.55, 73.73, 43.47, and 37.73 HT/mg in chicken blood, respectively, the human blood group (AB and O) showed considerable hemolytic activity of 73.73, 43.47, and 37.73 HT/mg, respectively, and the fraction (F3) had no activity. The acute toxic effect of the crude methanolic extract and fractions (F1, F2, and F3) showed the lethal dose (LD50) at 176, 121.5, 138, and 152 mg/kg body weight. The crude methanolic extract and fractions indicated strong analgesic activity at the ratio of 0.26, 0.37, 0.11, and 0.10 using the tail flick test in mice at 12.5 mg/kg body weight. These results suggest that the methanolic extract and its fractions fromC. scalpelliformismay be potential pharmacological agents.</abstract>

    <abstract>Neuromuscular disorders are a heterogeneous group of acquired or hereditary conditions that affect striated muscle function. The resulting decrease in muscle strength and motility irreversibly impacts quality of life. In addition to directly affecting skeletal muscle, pathogenesis can also arise from dysfunctional crosstalk between nerves and muscles, and may include cardiac impairment. Muscular weakness is often progressive and paralleled by continuous decline in the ability of skeletal muscle to functionally adapt and regenerate. Normally, the skeletal muscle resident stem cells, named satellite cells, ensure tissue homeostasis by providing myoblasts for growth, maintenance, repair and regeneration. We recently defined 'Satellite Cell-opathies’ as those inherited neuromuscular conditions presenting satellite cell dysfunction in muscular dystrophies and myopathies (doi:10.1016/j.yexcr.2021.112906). Here, we expand the portfolio of Satellite Cell-opathies by evaluating the potential impairment of satellite cell function across all 16 categories of neuromuscular disorders, including those with mainly neurogenic and cardiac involvement. We explore the expression dynamics of myopathogenes, genes whose mutation leads to skeletal muscle pathogenesis, using transcriptomic analysis. This revealed that 45% of myopathogenes are differentially expressed during early satellite cell activation (0-5 hours). Of these 271 myopathogenes, 83 respond to Pax7, a master regulator of satellite cells. Our analysis suggests possible perturbation of satellite cell function in many neuromuscular disorders across all categories, including those where skeletal muscle pathology is not predominant. This characterisation further aids understanding of pathomechanisms and informs on development of prognostic and diagnostic tools, and ultimately, new therapeutics.</abstract>

    <title>Habitat formed by the invasive macroalga Caulerpa filiformis (Suhr) Hering (Caulerpales, Chlorophyta) alters benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in Peru</title>
    <year>2022</year>
    <authors>Silvia Aguilar, Pippa J. Moore, Roberto A. Uribe</authors>
    <abstract>The green macroalgaCaulerpa filiformishas been spreading on shallow soft sediment habitats along the Peruvian coast, colonizing previously unvegetated sediments to create monospecific meadows. We examined the nature of the impact ofC. filiformismeadows on the density, taxonomic richness and assemblage structure of epifaunal and infaunal benthic macroinvertebrates. Specifically, we tested whether the spread ofC. filiformishas resulted in different macroinvertebrate assemblages than those formed by the dominant native macroalgae (i.e.,Rhodymeniaspp.) and unvegetated sediments. Surveys were undertaken in two bays in each of two locations, in central and southern Peru, during winter 2017 and summer 2018. In general, our results show that macroinvertebrate assemblages were similar across all three habitats, although there were some differences, related to location and time, but with no clear patterns observed. Taxonomic richness and density was generally higher in the vegetated habitats than the unvegetated habitat, and where there were differences between the two vegetated habitats there was no consistent pattern of which habitat supported the highest richness or density. Given invadingC. filiformisis primarily colonizing unvegetated habitats it would appear that this species is creating a new niche which supports similar assemblages, but higher taxonomic richness and density than unvegetated habitats. While our study suggests thatC. filiformisis having a limited ecological impact we recommend that actions be put in place to limit the spread of this invasive species at the same time as increasing monitoring of the ecological impacts of this species as lags in the ecological impacts of invasive species are common.</abstract>

    <abstract>The purpose of this study was to determine the administration of Caulerpa racemosa extract in clinical sign and intestinal histopathological profile of whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) after infected by Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The study was conducted using a completely randomized design (CRD) with six treatments and three replications. Shrimp were divided into six groups, two control groups without the administration of C. racemosa extract, the other four groups with the administration of C. racemosa extract with successive doses; 30 mg/kg (P1), 60 mg/kg (P2), 120 mg/kg (P3) and 240 mg/kg (P4) through feed. On the 15th day of rearing, the control group was divided into two groups: negative control (K-) was injected with PBS and then positive control (K+) and four other treatments (P1, P2, P3 and P4) were infected with V. parahaemolyticus. The results showed that intestinal damage caused by V. parahaemolyticus infection were inflammation and necrosis. The administration of C. racemosa extract had a significant effect on the histopathological profile of the whiteleg shrimp intestine. The lowest percentage of damage was found in the P4 treatment, which was 19.6% with a indication of low damage. Clinical sigs appeared at 48 hours post-infection pale hepatopancreas, empty intestines, reddened uropods and gnats. From this study, it can be concluded that the administration of C. racemosa extract to the feed at a dose of 240 mg/kg is the best dose in reducing the level of damage to the intestinal organs of whiteleg shrimp infected with V. parahaemolyticus.</abstract>

    <abstract>Abstract                                      Caulerpa racemosa  known as “sea grape” is green seaweed found in the coast of Balai Island Aceh Singkil, but the coastal community has not yet utilized this green seaweed. This study aimed to determine the antioxidant activity of  C. racemosa  extract from Balai Island Aceh Singkil. In research method, the sample of  C. racemosa  was collected from Balai Island Aceh Singkil and crude extracts were prepared using ethanol, ethyl acetate, and n-hexane. The yield and phytochemical assay were measured then followed by the in vitro antioxidant assays including CUPRAC and FRAP. The result showed the highest yield was found in the ethanol (1.36%), followed by n-hexane (0.45%) and ethyl acetate extract (0.405%).  C. racemosa  crude extract has contained phenolic, flavonoid and tannin compounds. Measurement of antioxidant activity using the CUPRAC and FRAP methods respectively showed that the ethanol extract had higher activity with a value of 46.45±4.03 μmol trolox/g and 358±1.41 μmol trolox/g, compared to crude extract of ethyl acetate with a value of 23.74±0.03 μmol trolox/g and 568±7.07 μmol trolox/g. While the value of n-hexane extract was 21.56±0.028 μmol trolox/g and 15 μmol trolox/g. Some of these bioactive compounds possess a new antioxidant agent with potential for nutraceutical industry.</abstract>

    <abstract>This research examines natural dyes' chemical and physical characteristics for potential use in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Chlorophyll pigments were extracted from two macroalgae species, Caulerpa racemosa and Gymnogongrus flabelliformis, and analyzed using absorbance spectroscopy, band gap energy calculations, and dye-sensitized solar cell performance evaluation. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) characterisation was used to identify the pigments contained in the dye. The absorbance spectra of chlorophyll pigments extracted from both macroalgae species showed broad peaks at 400–800 nm wavelengths, with Gymnogongrus flabelliformis showing the highest absorbance peak at 403 nm. The redox potential analysis for both macroalgae species showed energy gaps (HOMO/LUMO) of 1.3 eV, 1.4 eV, 2.3 eV, and 2.4 eV, respectively, indicating that these natural dyes are suitable for use in DSSC applications. DSSC devices were fabricated using components such as liquid electrolyte, mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO₂) photoelectrode, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as counter electrode, and ITO glass as conductive substrate. Meanwhile, to evaluate how well the photovoltaic system worked, we looked at short-circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and overall photoelectric conversion efficiency (η). The results showed that the highest performance for Gymnogongrus flabelliformis was Jsc 0.041 mA/cm², Voc 0.28 V, FF 0.239, and η 0.020%, while the highest performance of Caulerpa racemosa was Jsc 0.023 mA/cm², Voc 0.46 V, FF 0.244, and η 0.019%. These findings indicate the potential for using and developing natural dyes derived from these two macroalgae species in DSSC technology. This research offers insight into the feasibility of marine-derived pigments as a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative for photovoltaic applications.</abstract>

    <abstract>Data are presented on the average daily milk yield of cows during the mass abundance of horseflies, mosquitoes and midges depending on the technology of keeping animals in the Tyumen region. Keeping the cows during this period without grazing on the walking grounds at the farm is one of the methods of preserving their milk productivity. During the period of mass flight of gnats, the milk productivity of cattle grazing in forest pastures is significantly reduced. Loss of milk during this period is 13.68%, while the longer the harmful effects of the vulture, the more significant these losses.

    <title>Analysis of Minerals and Heavy Metals Using ICP-OES and FTIR Techniques in Two Red Seaweeds (Gymnogongrus griffithsiae and Asparagopsis taxiformis) from Tunisia</title>

    <abstract>In this study, the mineral and heavy metals (arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), mercury (Hg), potassium (K), manganese (Mn), sodium (Na), phosphorus (P), and lead (Pb)) in two red Tunisian seaweedsGymnogongrus griffithsiae(G. griffithsiae) andAsparagopsis taxiformis(A. taxiformis), were evaluated. Mineral and trace element analyses were achieved using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to predict the major functional groups that would be implicated in the seaweeds mineral uptake. Our results showed that the studiedA. taxiformisspecies had much higher mineral and heavy metal concentrations thanG. griffithsiae. Na (200.60 mg/kg) was the most abundant element followed by K (137.84 mg/kg) &gt; P (35.93 mg/kg) forA. taxiformisspecies. However, only Na (165.23 mg/kg) and P (51.19 mg/kg) were detected inG. griffithsiaealga. As regards heavy and toxic metals, allowable concentrations have been found in both seaweeds. The concentration ranges for the most undesirable heavy metals were as follows: Pb (0.39–0.51 mg/kg), As (0.11–0.40 mg/kg), Cd (0.01–0.02 mg/kg), and Hg (0.00–0.02 mg/kg). According to FTIR analysis, the major functional groups present in the studied seaweeds were carboxyl, hydroxyl, sulfate, and phosphate groups that are considered as excellent binding sites for metal retention.</abstract>

    <abstract>La croissance du carraghénophyte, Gymnogongrus patens J. Agardh (Rhodophyta, Phyllophoraceae) a été analysée sur des échantillons d’algues récoltés mensuellement pendant un cycle annuel, d’avril 2002 à mars 2003, sur la plage de Méhdia (Nord ouest de la côte atlantique marocaine). L’analyse des paramètres de croissance (longueur, poids et nombre total de ramifications) de l’algue a montré que sa croissance est plus liée à la prolifération des ramifications qu’à l’élongation des thalles.L’influence des facteurs environnementaux (température, salinité, nitrates, et phosphates) sur l’évolution de la croissance a été étudiée par des analyses en composantes principales (ACP). L’analyse quantitative en composantes principales a montré une variation saisonnière des trois paramètres de croissance. Ainsi, les variables poids, ramifications totales,température, salinité et concentration en nitrates sont corrélées positivement avec l’axe factoriel F1. L‘axe factoriel F2 est corrélé positivement aux variables longueur du thalle et concentration en phosphates. Il est à noter que les teneurs en phosphates sont corrélées négativement avec l’axe F1.Mots-clés: Gymnogongrus patens, croissance, analyses statistiques, Maroc.</abstract>

In normal phase silica gel, Sephadex LH-20 gel column chromatography, reverse phase HPLC, and recrystallization. Based on MS and 1D NMR spectroscopic data, their structures were determined as: stigmast-4-en-3-one (I), cholest-4-en-3-one (II), cholesterol (III), uracil (IV), uridine (V), adenosine (VI), succinic acid (VII), and 5-hydroxy-4-methyl-5-pentyl-2,5-dihydro-furan-2-on (VIII). All of them were obtained from this species for the first time. Cytotoxicity of these compounds was screened using standard MTT method, but all the compounds were inactive (IC50&gt; 10 μg/ml).</abstract>

    <abstract>ABSTRACT  Carpospores of Gymnogongrus linearis (C. Ag.) J. Ag. collected from Sonoma Co., California were cultured and gave rise to crustose plants. Tetrasporogenesis could not be induced. However, tetraspores from field‐collected crustose tetrasporophytes found near G. linearis from San Mateo Co., California were cultured. These field crusts superficially resemble Petrocelis middendorffii (Ruprecht) Kjellman, but differ in size, color, number of tetrasporangia per filament, and distal dichotomous branching of the perithallial filaments. Tetraspores gave rise to upright plants identical to G. linearis. Gymnogongrus leptophyllus J. Ag. collected from California and Baja California, Mexico were found as narrow and wide forms. Narrow form isolates recycled directly without producing a crustose tetrasporophyte. These are interpreted as apogamous. Carpospores of the wide form grew into crusts resembling Petrocelis (=Erythrodermis) haematis Hollenberg. Tetrasporogenesis was induced in culture by abrasion or dehydration. Tetraspores from field‐collected crusts and laboratory cultured tetrasporophytes grew into plants identical to G. leptophyllus , completing a sexual life history with an alternation of heteromorphic generations.</abstract>

    <title>A MOLECULAR AND MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE &lt;i&gt;GYMNOGONGRUS DEVONIENSIS&lt;/i&gt; (RHODOPHYTA) COMPLEX IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;</title>

    <abstract>ABSTRACT  The  Gymnogongrus devoniensis  (Greville) Schotter complex in the North Atlantic Ocean was elucidated by comparative molecular, morphological, and culture studies. Restriction fragment length patterns and hybridization data on organellar DNA revealed two distinct taxa in samples from Europe and eastern Canada. Nucleotide sequences for the intergenic spacer between the large and small subunit genes of ribulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), and the adjoining regions of both genes, differed by 12.5–13.4% between the two taxa. One of the taxa, which included material from the type locality of  G. devoniensis  at Torbay, Devon, England, was taken to represent authentic  G. devoniensis.  Within this taxon, samples from Ireland, England, northern France, northern Spain, and southern Portugal showed great morphological variation, particularly in habit, but their Rubisco spacer sequences were identical or differed by only a single nucleotide. Constant morphological features included the development, from a single auxiliary cell, of the spherical cystocarp with a thick mucilage sheath that appears to be typical of  Gymnogongrus  species with internal cystocarps. Two life‐history types were found. Northern isolates underwent a direct‐type life history, recycling apomictic females by carpospores, whereas the Portuguese isolate followed a heteromorphic life history in which carpospores gave rise to a crustose tetrasporophyte.  The second group of samples, from Nova Scotia and Northern Ireland, provisionally referred to as  Gymnogongrus  sp., showed little morphological variation. The life history in both areas consists of apomictically reproducing diploid female gametophytes and diploid crustose bisporophytes and tetrasporophytes. Rubisco spacer sequences of the samples were identical, and the plasmid previously described in the Nova Scotian samples was also present in the Northern Ireland population. This species is widely distributed in the western Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Massachusetts. In Europe, gametophytes are known only at one site, but crusts are distributed from Denmark, Scotland (and probably Norway) to France. It is very likely that this species was introduced from one side of the North Atlantic to the other by shipping during the early nineteenth century. Several morphological features are unusual within the genus but are shared with  G. leptophyllus  J. Agardh from the eastern Pacific Ocean, and further work is necessary to determine whether  Gymnogongrus  sp. and  G. leptophyllus  are conspecific.</abstract>

    <abstract>Carrageenans biosynthesized by gametophytic and tetrasporic plants of seaweeds belonging to the Gigartinaceae and Phyllophoraceae are different: gametophytes produce carrageenans of the kappa family, whereas lambda‐carrageenans are extracted from tetrasporophytes. For  Gigartina skottsbergii  Setchell and Gardner and  Gymnogongrus torulosus  Hooker et Harvey, mature cystocarps were isolated and carrageenans were extracted. Structural determination by methylation analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and  13 C‐NMR spectroscopy showed that they were kappa/iota‐carrageenans. For the extract obtained from cystocarps of  Gigartina skottsbergii  with water at room temperature, the ratio kappa:iota was 1:0.30 and at 90° C was 1:0.43; significant amounts of precursors were also present. The extract obtained from cystocarps of  Gymnogongrus torulosus  at 90° C showed prevalence of iota‐carrageenans (ratio kappa:iota 1:1.21). These extracts are similar to the polysaccharides produced by gametophytes of these seaweeds. For  Gigartina skottsbergii , it was possible to separate the pericarpic tissue from the carposporophyte. Thus, they were extracted separately, and the carrageenans isolated were studied as described before, obtaining similar conclusions. These results clearly show that whereas the carposporophytes are located inside the cystocarp, they produce carrageenans of the kappa family despite of being diploid cells.</abstract>

    <title>Novel DL-Galactan Hybrids from the Red Seaweed &lt;i&gt;Gymnogongrus Torulosus&lt;/i&gt; are Potent Inhibitors of Herpes Simplex Virus and Dengue Virus</title>
    <year>2002</year>
    <authors>CA Pujol, JM Estevez, MJ Carlucci, M Ciancia, AS Cerezo, EB Damonte</authors>
    <abstract>A novel series of DL-galactan hybrids extracted from the red seaweed Gymnogongrus torulosus, was evaluated for its in vitro antiviral properties against herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and dengue virus 2 (DEN-2). These compounds were very active against both viruses with inhibitory concentration 50% (IC 50 ) values in the range 0.6–16 μg/ml for HSV-2 and 0.19–1.7 μg/ml for DEN-2, respectively, as determined in a virus plaque reduction assay in Vero cells. The DL-galactans lacked of cytotoxic effects, on stationary as well as on actively dividing cells, and anticoagulant properties. Some of the compounds showed a variable level of direct inactivating effect on both virions, with virucidal concentration 50% values exceeding the IC 50 s obtained by plaque reduction assay. Full inhibitory activity was achieved when the galactans were present during virus adsorption period, suggesting that the mode of action of these compounds is an interference in the binding of the surface envelope glycoprotein with the cell receptor.</abstract>

    <title>CO‐OCCURRENCE OF CARRAGEENANS AND AGAROIDS IN &lt;i&gt;GYMNOGONGRUS TORULOSUS&lt;/i&gt; (GIGARTINALES, PHYLLOPHORACEAE) FROM ARGENTINA</title>

    <authors>J. M. Estevez, M Ciancia, A.S. Cerezo</authors>
    <abstract>The red seaweeds,  Gigartina skottbetgii  and  Sarcothalia crispata , have commercial value as raw material for the industrial production of phycocolloids (carrageenans) in Argentina. The third alga with potencial possibilities for the carrageenan production is  Gymnogongrus torulosus.  Herein, we report the study of the polysaccharide system present in  Gymnogongrus torulosus , which contribute to the estimation of the importance of this algae in the seaweed industry. Analysis of the hot water‐soluble extract (C1), by FT‐IR, methylation and  13 C NMR, showed mainly the presence of iota/kappa carrageenan hybrid (molar ratio ∼ 2:1). The soluble fractions obtained after KCl fractionation (F3, 16.1 % of C1) and soluble after alkaline treatment and KCl fractionation (F3T3, 34.6% of F3T) gave negative optical rotations (−15.5 and −55.4, respectively), considerably lower than those reported for kappa/iota carrageenans (from 56.1 to 66.5). These fractions (F3 and F3T3) have significant quantities of L‐galactose (11.1% and 29.8%) and L‐3,6‐anhydrogalactose (19.2% and 4.3%). The direct relationship between the optical rotation and the percentage of L‐galactose indicated that its structural influence is similar in all the fractions. The results suggest that  Gymnogongrus torulosus  biosynthesizes a polysaccharide system with co‐occurrence of carrageenans and agaroids in the same thallus.</abstract>

    <abstract>ABSTRACT Islamic banking in Indonesia and Malaysia experienced differences in asset growth and market share, potentially causing dissimilarity in profitability performance. This study aims to evaluate the factors that influence the increase in profitability of Islamic banking in Indonesia and Malaysia using signaling theory including market concentration (HHI), company size and financing risk (NPF), and national income (GDP) as control variables. It analyzed the Indonesian and Malaysian Islamic banks during the period 2017-2021. The method used in this study is comparative descriptive with panel data regression analysis measuring instruments. Based on the results of empirical analysis, factors that affect the profitability of Islamic banking in Indonesia are financing risk, while in Malaysia, it is financing risk and national income. The results of this study update the view on the profitability of Islamic banking in Indonesia and Malaysia. In addition, from the managerial side, this study contributes to creating NPF control in Indonesian Islamic banking because these factors can increase the profitability of the country's Islamic banking. The study also contributes to the development of market concentration strategies, company size, and financing risks in Malaysian Islamic banking as all these factors can increase the profitability of the country's Islamic banking.

    <title>Relation between chemical composition of Grateloupia doryphora (Montagne) Howe, Gymnogongrus griffithsiae (Turner) Martius, and abiotic parameters</title>
    <year>1998</year>
    <authors>Paulo Nelo Medeiros Perfeto</authors>
    <abstract>In Grateloupia doryphora and Gymnogongrus griffithsiae the seasonal variation of their chemical compounds was studied, establishing a relation with the physical and chemical properties of seawater. High values of proteins in the studied species were detected during the winter, 28.88% in G. doryphora and 26.68% in G. griffithsiae, corresponding to the maximum period of ammonium concentration in the marine environment. The variation in carbohydrates content showed an inverse relation with the proteins, with a maximum of 54.72% in G. doryphora and of 55.36% in G. griffithsiae, both in summer, positively correlated with salinity and temperature of sea water. Lipids content was low in both species. In G. doryphora the values ranged between 0.81 and 1.30% and, in G. griffithsiae, from 0.71 to 1.50% of dry weight, showing a direct relation with the amount of nitrogen in the seawater. The maximum content of ashes, phosphorus and potassium occurred in autumn and winter, respectively, with 11.85%, 0.20%, 1.27% in G. doryphora, and 14.46%, 0.14%, 1.41% in G. griffithsiae.</abstract>

    <title>Ecological studies for harvesting and culturing Gymnogongrus furcellatus (Rhodophyta, Gigartinales) in Central Chile</title>
    <year>1989</year>
    <authors>B. Santelices, P. Camus, A. J. Hoffmann</authors>
    <abstract>Every year, several hundred tonnes of dryGymnogongrus furcellatusare exported from Chile for carrageenan production. The present study provides ecological information for rational harvesting practices, including an understanding of the effects of environmental factors on growth. Field results indicate that the species is abundant in areas where disturbing factors do not destroy the crustose base of the plants, which can survive sand burial, but is grazing sensitive. In central Chile the erect axes have a clear seasonal pattern of growth which, as extrapolated from laboratory experiments, is most affected by seasonal changes in quantum dosage and photoperiod. Laboratory experiments show that vitamins and CO2additions also influence growth rates significantly. Field data indicate that harvesting in central Chile should be done bi-monthly, within the six most productive months of the year and be stopped before March, when the female gametophytes become fertile. Hand picking is the least destructive harvesting method. Even though the daily growth rate of the species could be raised to 7% in laboratory experiments, tank cultivation appears uneconomical. The cost of some of the factors required for the growth of this species, such as daily vitamin additions, aeration and CO2supplements, are unlikely to be recovered by the 25% average carrageenan content of this species. In addition, the high light requirements of the species would restrict culture to only 6 months a year at these latitudes. Therefore adequate management of the beds is required for sustained production.</abstract>

    <title>Occurrence of L-amino acid oxidase in the marine red alga Gymnogongrus flabelliformis.</title>
    <year>1982</year>
    <authors>Shigeki FUJISAWA, Kanji HORI, Keisuke MIYAZAWA</authors>
    <abstract>The L-amino acid oxidase of the marine red algaGymnogongrus flabelliformiswas partially purified and studied.The enzyme was purified about 45-fold in a yield of 13% by means of acetone precipitation, gel filtration, and DEAE-Sephadex column chromatography. This enzyme had very limited specificity, catalyzing the oxidative deamination of basic L-amino acids and methionine. The relative activeties for the amino acids at pH 8.0 were as follows: 100 for L-gigartinine, 84 for L-arginine, 83 for L-ornithine, 54 for L-lysine, 29 for L-citrulline, 23 for L-histidine and 20 for L-methionine. D-Amino acids were not oxidized. L-Arginine, which was used as the substrate of the enzyme reaction was oxidized to equimolar amounts of α-keto acid and ammonia with consumption of equimolar oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide formation was also detected. These results led the authors to postulate that the enzyme is a kind of L-amino acid oxidase. The pH-activity curve had a relative broad maximum between pH 8.0 and 9.0. The optimum temperature was about 30°C. The enzyme activity was inhibited by the treatment of EDTA, but it was reactivated by some metal ions. Ca2+was the most preferable. The occurrence of L-amino acid oxidase in marine algae is demonstrated for the first time.</abstract>

    <abstract>Summary  Lewis, J. A.: Transfer of the Australian red algae  Kallymenia nitophylloides  to  Cryptonemia (Halymeniaceae)  and  Halymenia chondrkola  to  Hymenocladia (Rhodymeniaceae). – Taxon  43: 3‐10. 1994. – ISSN 0040‐0262.  Type material of  Kallymenia nitophylloides  J. Agardh from northern New South Wales was found to be taxonomically identical to plants collected recently at a number of sites further south in New South Wales and in Victoria. The new material has reproductive and vegetative features consistent with the genus  Cryptonemia (Halymeniaceae).  The combination  Cryptonemia nitophylloides  (J. Agardh) J. A. Lewis is therefore proposed. The holotype of  Halymenia chondrkola  Sond. from Western Australia was found to belong in the genus  Hymenocladia (Rhodymeniaceae).  The species corresponds with that generally reported in southern Australia as  Hymenocladia polymorpha  (Harv.) J. Agardh and in New Zealand as  Hymenocladia sanguínea  (Harv.) Sparling. As the name  Halymenia chondricola  predates both of the Harvey basionyms, the binomial  Hymenocladia chondrkola  (Sond.) J. A. Lewis is proposed. Lectotypes are designated for  Rhodymenia polymorpha  Harv. and the related yet distinct  Calliblepharis conspersa  Harv.</abstract>

    <abstract>The rare endemic Mediterranean algaKallymenia spathulatawas collected at Nice and Saint Raphael in June 2013 during a survey conducted along the French Mediterranean coast between Menton and Toulon (French Riviera). DNA barcode sequences (COI-5P) generated from the five collected specimens were identical and allied withFelicinia marginata,another Mediterranean endemic that is classified within the Halymeniaceae (Halymeniales) whereas the genusKallymeniais representative of the Kallymeniaceae (Gigartinales). We further confirmed the alliance ofK. spathulatawithFelicinia marginataby conducting phylogenetic analyses inferred by combined genes including Cox1,rbcL and LSU. Unfortunately, none of the specimens were fertile, precluding emending the description of the reproductive anatomy of this species. In light of our phylogenies, we propose the novel combinationFelicinia spathulata. The genusFelicinianow comprises two species, both endemic to the Mediterranean Sea.</abstract>

    <title>Formation of Secondary Connecting Filaments, A New Post-Fertilisation Stage in Mediterranean Species of&lt;i&gt;Kallymenia&lt;/i&gt;(Kallymeniaceae, Rhodophyta)</title>
    <year>2011</year>
    <authors>Nadia Abdelahad, Roberta D'Archino</authors>
    <abstract>A new post-fertilisation stage, consisting of secondary connecting filaments produced from the primary connecting filament in the vicinity of the auxiliary cell branch system, was observed in Mediterranean monocarpogonial and polycarpogonial species ofKallymenia. In the monocarpogonial species the connecting filaments were formed from a little modified primary connecting filament close to the auxiliary cell and in the polycarpogonial species they were produced from a highly modified, swollen, hyaline portion of the primary connecting filament that remained attached to the auxiliary cell. Since most of these connecting filaments were seen clearly linked by pit connections in both instances, they are interpreted as secondary connecting filaments produced in essentially the same way as the primary connecting filaments that derive from the carpogonial branch fusion cell.</abstract>

    <title>DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARPOSPOROPHYTE OF &lt;i&gt;KALLYMENIA RENIFORMIS&lt;/i&gt; (TURNER) J. AGARDH&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;</title>
    <year>2008</year>
    <authors>Max H. Hommersand, D. W. Ott</authors>
    <abstract>SUMMARY  The development of the carposporophyte in  Kallymenia reniformis  involves an elaborate series of interactions between reproductive and vegetative tissues. Following fertilization, the inner cells of the carpogonial branches form processes that unite with the supporting cell and with each other, giving rise to a large fusion cell. A number of medullary filaments are enveloped and incorporated within the developing fusion cell. Secondary filaments may be produced from medullary cells outside the fusion cell after connecting filaments have been initiated.  Connecting filaments are nonseptale and wind their way through the medulla. The presence of a connecting filament in the vicinity of an auxiliary cell appears to initiate a complex sequence of responses. Vegetative filaments are produced in the medulla and inner cortex that grow centripetally toward the auxiliary cell and fuse with one another, forming a network of secondary tissue. One of the vegetative cells may penetrate the auxiliary cell, while others intrude into subsidiary cells connecting them with the network. An ostiolate pericarp is initiated in the cortex above the auxiliary cell. The connecting filament fuses with the auxiliary cell and also with some of the surrounding vegetative cells, forming an irregular lobed structure. Gonimoblast is initiated in scattered pockets from vegetative cells in the vicinity of the auxiliary cell apparatus.</abstract>

    <title>On Two Species of Kallymenia (Rhodophyta: Gigartinales: Kallymeniaceae) from the Hawaiian Islands, Central Pacific</title>
    <year>2002</year>
    <authors>Isabella Aiona Abbott, Karla J. McDermid</authors>
    <abstract>Two species of Kallymenia from the Hawaiian Islands, one rare, K. sessilis Okamura, and the other described here for the first time, K. thompsonii, n. sp., are examined, compared, and contrasted with other similar Kallymenia species. Both species are unusual because Kallymenia is generally regarded as a temperate taxon, and tropical or subtropical species are seldom encountered. The two species are alike in that they have a female reproductive apparatus that is monocarpogonial: wherein a single carpogonial filament is associated with a supporting cell also bearing an arrangement of subsidiary cells that is characteristic of some of the family Kallymeniaceae. In the genus Kallymenia, vegetative components shown in a cross section are a narrow outer cortex, often only three cells thick, followed inwardly by one to two layers of subcortical cells. In the two species studied here, there appears to be a constant shape and arrangement of subcortical cells in each species, whereas the number of medullary filaments and their arrangements appear to be less stable in their configuration than the subcortical cells. Branched refractive cells or stellate cells, which often occur in species of Kallymenia, were not seen in K. thompsonii and only rarely in K. sessilis. Kallymenia thompsonii commonly has perforations in the maturing blades, whereas K. sessilis does not.</abstract>

    <title>Geographical Distribution, Habitat and Reproductive Phenology of the Genus Kallymenia (Gigartinales, Rhodophyta) from Catalonia, Spain</title>
    <year>2001</year>
    <authors>C. Rodríguez-Prieto, A. Vergés</authors>
    <abstract>The authors report the geographical distribution, habitat and reproductive phenology of the four species of the genusKallymeniafrom Catalonia, Spain:K. feldmanniiCodomier,K. lacerataJ. Feldmann,K. patens(J. Agardh) Parkinson andK. requieniiJ. Agardh. The records confirm that these species are quite common in the western Mediterranean Sea, but are very rare in the eastern Mediterranean region, where onlyK. lacerataandK. requieniihave been found once. In addition, the examination of different herbaria shows thatK. requieniiis present on the Atlantic coast of the north of Spain. The four species are sciophilous and live preferably in the coralligen or in the maerl, usually at depths of more than 30 m in the northernMediterranean Sea or below 40 m in the central and southern Mediterranean Sea. All species are highly proterandrous.Kallymenia feldmanniiandK. lacerataare annual and ensure survival in winter by developing incrusting discs from carpospores and tetraspores.Kallymenia patensandK. requieniiare perennial, and ensure survival by maintaining only the basal part of the blade from one year to the other and developing new blades from it in spring. The perennial species, on aging, accumulate floridean starch in the intermediate cortical layers, which takes the form of whitish spots on the blade surface; the older thalli are totally whitish.</abstract>

    <title>An Unusual Protuberant &lt;i&gt;Lithophyllum&lt;/i&gt; sp. From Southern Spain Increases Structural Complexity in Urchin Barrens</title>
    <year>2025</year>
    <authors>Dino Angelo E. Ramos, Jesús Del Río, Julio Peñas, Juan C. Braga</authors>
    <abstract>ABSTRACT  Urchin barrens (‘blanquizales’) are habitats dominated by encrusting non‐geniculate coralline algae and maintained by urchin grazing. Taxonomic information of coralline communities in Mediterranean blanquizales is limited. Lumpy to fruticose coralline algal specimens, unusual in blanquizales, were found along the southern Spanish coast. Sequences from these specimens resolved with foliose samples morpho‐anatomically identified as  Lithophyllum dentatum . Initial observations suggested that this protuberant  Lithophyllum  species increases diversity in the otherwise species‐poor exposed blanquizales. When present, higher macroalgal cover was observed with algae and microfauna frequently observed as epibiotic among the coralline's protuberances.</abstract>

    <abstract>A crustose red alga,Lithophyllum neo-okamuraeA.Kato, D.Basso, Caragnano, Rodondi, V.Peña &amp; M.Baba, is reported a new record from Korea and its biogeographic distributions are extended in Korea.Lithophyllum neo-okamuraehas been known as endemic species in Japan. Despite the resemblance between L. neookamurae andL. okamurae, our molecular and morphological analyses have revealed the simultaneous presence of both species in Korea. Although L. neo-okamurae andL. okamuraeshare morphological similarities, there are notable variations in gene sequences, with a range of 9.1-11.3% inpsbA and 14.8-15.3% inrbcL. Specifically, while L. neo-okamurae is distributed throughout the entire coastline of Korea,L. okamuraeis predominantly found in southern region. Furthermore, our analyses have revealed their detailed distributions in Korea.</abstract>

    <abstract>SUMMARY   Lithophyllum  is a cosmopolitan coralline algal genus with 12 species currently recognized in Japan based on modern morpho‐anatomical taxonomic concepts primarily characterized by having uniporate tetrasporangial and bisporangial conceptacles, the presence of secondary pit‐connections between cells of adjacent filaments and a dimerous thallus construction with a single basal layer of predominantly non‐palisade cells. In the present study, we describe  Lithophyllum nagaokaense  sp. nov. based on a combination of molecular and morpho‐anatomical data of specimens from the temperate waters of Japan. The new species forms both attached epilithic thalli and free‐living rhodoliths. Phylogenetic analyses of  psb A,  rbc L and COI markers resolved  L. nagaokaense  as an independent species. Morpho‐anatomically,  L. nagaokaense  resembles  Lithophyllum johansenii , originally described from Australia, but distinguished from the latter by the absence of enlarged angular cells occluding pore canals of tetrasporangial conceptacle chambers.  Lithophyllum nagaokaense  shared a fruticose morphology with  Lithophyllum kaiseri ,  Lithophyllum kuroshioense, Lithophyllum neo‐okamurae, Lithophyllum okamurae,  and  Lithophyllum pygmaeum  from Japan. Of these,  L. nagaokaense  is the most similar to  L. neo‐okamurae  in having attached and free‐living thalli with encrusting and warty to lumpy growth forms bearing knobby protuberances that are dichotomously branched or anastomosing. The new species is distinct from other Japanese fruticose species collectively by five tetrasporangial conceptacle chamber characters and the absence of trichocytes. A taxonomic key for identifying Japanese fruticose species is provided. This is the fifth  Lithophyllum  species and the third rhodolith‐forming species verified by DNA sequencing to be found in Japan.</abstract>

    <title>Impact of sea level rise on the Mediterranean Lithophyllum byssoides rims</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Aurélie Blanfuné, Charles-François Boudouresque, Marc Verlaque, Antoine Minne, Fanny Noisette, Thierry Thibaut</authors>
    <abstract>Abstract  The calcified red macroalga  Lithophyllum byssoides , a very common midlittoral species in the western Mediterranean Sea, is a significant ecosystem engineer capable, under exposed and dim light conditions, of building wide and solid endemic bioconstructions near the mean sea level: the  L. byssoides  rims or ' trottoirs à L. byssoides' . Although the growth of the species is relatively rapid for a calcified alga, the construction of a large rim requires several centuries of near stable or slowly rising sea level. As the time scale of their formation is measured in centuries,  L. byssoides  bioconstructions constitute valuable and sensitive sea level markers. The health status of  L. byssoides  rims has been studied at two sites located far apart from each other (Marseille and Corsica), both in areas heavily impacted by humans and in areas with little impact (MPAs and unprotected areas). A health index is proposed:  Lithophylum byssoides  Rims Health Index. The main and inevitable threat is the rise in the sea level. This ecosystem would be the first case worldwide of marine ecosystem collapse resulting, indirectly, from man-induced global change.</abstract>

    <title>Branching Lithophyllum Coralline Algae: Dominant Reef Builders on Herbivory-Depressed Tropical Reefs after High Coral Mortality</title>
    <year>2023</year>
    <authors>Tom Schils</authors>
    <abstract>A unique shift in benthic community composition, where scleractinian corals are replaced by coralline algae, has been observed on coral reefs in Guam in the western Pacific. Guam’s reefs have been subjected to intense fishing pressure and impaired water quality for decades. Since 2013, heat stress has emerged as an additional major threat to the island’s coral reefs. After a severe coral bleaching and mortality event in 2017, branching coralline algae of the genus Lithophyllum rapidly overgrew dead coral skeletons of the ecosystem engineer Acropora abrotanoides and have since become major components of forereef communities over a broad depth range. By now, the persistence of increased Lithophyllum cover meets the temporal criterium of phase shifts, but accurate estimates on the degree of dominance over appropriate spatial scales are lacking due to the absence of reliable baseline data. The ecological impacts of coral reef transitions towards increased coralline cover are unclear. Whereas carbonate budgets and reef growth could remain positive in the long term, the downstream effect of changes in structural complexity, (micro)habitat diversity, and benthic community composition on ecological processes and reef-associated faunal assemblages is unknown.</abstract>

    <abstract>The aim of this study was to elucidate the taxonomy of the common but overlooked epiphytic coralline algae species from shallow reefs and seagrass meadows of the Abrolhos Archipelago, Brazil. Two thin (two vegetative cells thick) epiphytic coralline species were recorded: Lithophyllum epiphyticum sp. nov. and Hydrolithon farinosum. Molecular analysis from psbA genetic marker confirmed the position of L. epiphyticum into Lithophylloideae and revealed a phylogenetic relationship with an undescribed Lithophyllum from Italy. Thin thallus (2–3 cells thick) and cells lining the pore of tetrasporangial conceptacles protruding laterally occluding the canal, either partially or totally, are its main diagnostic characteristics. Hydrolithon farinosum is herein described in detail for Brazil, and its worldwide distribution is then discussed.</abstract>

    <abstract>Neuromuscular disorders are a heterogeneous group of acquired or hereditary conditions that affect striated muscle function. The resulting decrease in muscle strength and motility irreversibly impacts quality of life. In addition to directly affecting skeletal muscle, pathogenesis can also arise from dysfunctional crosstalk between nerves and muscles, and may include cardiac impairment. Muscular weakness is often progressive and paralleled by continuous decline in the ability of skeletal muscle to functionally adapt and regenerate. Normally, the skeletal muscle resident stem cells, named satellite cells, ensure tissue homeostasis by providing myoblasts for growth, maintenance, repair and regeneration. We recently defined 'Satellite Cell-opathies’ as those inherited neuromuscular conditions presenting satellite cell dysfunction in muscular dystrophies and myopathies (doi:10.1016/j.yexcr.2021.112906). Here, we expand the portfolio of Satellite Cell-opathies by evaluating the potential impairment of satellite cell function across all 16 categories of neuromuscular disorders, including those with mainly neurogenic and cardiac involvement. We explore the expression dynamics of myopathogenes, genes whose mutation leads to skeletal muscle pathogenesis, using transcriptomic analysis. This revealed that 45% of myopathogenes are differentially expressed during early satellite cell activation (0-5 hours). Of these 271 myopathogenes, 83 respond to Pax7, a master regulator of satellite cells. Our analysis suggests possible perturbation of satellite cell function in many neuromuscular disorders across all categories, including those where skeletal muscle pathology is not predominant. This characterisation further aids understanding of pathomechanisms and informs on development of prognostic and diagnostic tools, and ultimately, new therapeutics.</abstract>

    <abstract>Understanding how coralline algae may acclimatize to ocean warming is important to understand their survival over the coming century. Taking advantage of natural differences in temperature conditions between coastal areas in Sardinia (Italy) and between depths, the responses in terms of biological traits to warming of the crustose coralline alga  Lithophyllum stictiforme , a key bioconstructor of coralligenous reefs in the Mediterranean, were evaluated in the field by two innovative transplant experiments where translocated specimens were used as controls. Results of the first experiment (algae cross transplanted between a cold and a warm site at two depths, 23 and 34 m) showed that the marginal growth of the alga and production of conceptacles were higher in the cold site, regardless of the treatment (transplant and translocation) and depth. However, growth in thickness in algae transferred from the cold to the warm site was higher at 34 m of depth, where they had a better performance than the local (translocated) algae. Results of the second experiment (algae transplanted from 34 m to 15 m of depth under different light irradiance manipulations) evidenced that the increase in temperature of +4°C was tolerated by thalli transplanted at 15 m, but that thallus growth and conceptacles production was negatively affected by the higher light irradiance. These results suggest an overall good adaptability of  L. stictiforme  under warmer conditions, even those due to thermocline deepening. Overall, these results encourage consideration of the use of transplants of this bioconstructor in future restoration actions of coralligenous habitats.</abstract>

    <title>Ontogeny and Early Steps of the Calcification Process in Coralline Algae Lithophyllum corallinae (Florideophyceae, Rhodophyta)</title>
    <year>2022</year>

    <abstract>Coralline algae (Rhodophyta, Florideophyceae) are one of the most abundant organisms in the hard-bottom marine photic zone where they provide settlement substrates, structure and shelter on rocky substrates. Coralline algae also play important roles in tropical reefs, both cementing corals together and producing substantial amounts of calcium carbonate. The ecological roles of coralline algae in the marine environment are related to the biomineralization process that occurs in the cell walls. Currently, this group of algae is receiving renewed attention from researchers from different fields, especially due to possible effects of climate changes over its magnesium calcite skeleton. Despite this renewed attention, we still have poor information regarding the first steps of coralline algae ontogeny and calcification. The aim of this study was to describe the earlier steps of Lithophyllum corallinae development and its calcification process. Algae were collected at Vermelha Beach, Rio de Janeiro city. Adult crusts released spores that settled over microscope slides. The germinating spores were analyzed by Polarizing Light Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy. Results showed that cell walls mineralization begins at third spore cell division (8 cells specimen), evidenced by changes in light polarization, elemental composition and hardness, restricted to the cell walls of the innermost part of the developing spore. Nanopores in calcite crystals structure were identified, evidencing macromolecules occlusion, a feature especially important to prevent calcite skeleton cracking in high-energy environments. The beginning of this process could be related to spore size, availability of organic matrix and energy from photosynthesis. All the analysis also confirmed the lack of calcification in the cell walls of the outermost part of the germinating spore, which allows the growth of the individual; but mainly indicates a high level of control in coralline algae mineralization process, representing a relevant information in future studies on coralline algae calcification, including those testing climate changes scenarios.</abstract>

    <title>Insights into the Migration Routes and Historical Dispersion of Species Surviving the Messinian Crisis: The Case of Patella ulyssiponensis and Epizoic Rhodolith Lithophyllum hibernicum</title>
    <year>2021</year>
    <authors>Nuno Gomes, Carlos Antunes, Dimítri de Araújo Costa</authors>
    <abstract>The genus Patella (Patellogastropoda, Mollusca) is represented by a group of species exclusive to the Northeast Atlantic Ocean (including Macaronesian archipelagos) and Mediterranean Sea. The species Patella ulyssiponensis and Patella aspera are common in European waters, with the first inhabiting continental coast, and the second endemic to Macaronesian archipelagos. However, the acceptance of these two lineages as separate species is still highly debated. The red coralline species algae Lithophyllum hibernicum, distributed from Northeast Atlantic to the Mediterranean, is usually found as epilithic crusts or unattached forms (named rhodolith beds), although it also forms epizoic crusts on other organisms, e.g., shell surfaces. In order to study the historic dispersal and migration routes of the Patella ulyssiponensis-aspera complex, taxonomic, genetic and biogeographic approaches were employed based on haplotype network analyses and estimations for the most common recent ancestor (TMRCA), using Cytochrome Oxydase I. A synonymy for these two species is proposed, with the presence of a shared haplotype between the continental (P. ulyssiponensis) and insular (P. aspera) lineages, and with basis of morphological and nomenclatural data. We propose an evolutionary scenario for its dispersal based on a high haplotype diversity for the Mediterranean regions, indicating its possible survival during the Messinian Salinity Crisis (6–5.3 Mya), followed by a colonization of the Proto-Macaronesian archipelagos. The epizoic association of L. hibernicum on P. ulyssiponensis shell adult surface is recorded in this study, likewise the promotion of settlement conditions provided by these coralline algae to P. ulyssiponensis larvae, may explain the reach of P. ulyssiponensis distribution through rhodolith transportation.</abstract>

    <title>Lithophyllum artabricum V.Peña, sp. nov. (Corallinales, Rhodophyta): A Cryptic Species in the Atlantic Iberian Peninsula Hitherto Assigned to Lithophyllum stictiforme (Areschoug) Hauck</title>
    <year>2021</year>
    <authors>Viviana Peña, Tamara Ruiz De Gauna Torres</authors>
    <abstract>Lithophyllum stictiforme(Areschoug) Hauck contributes to the formation of the Mediterranean coralligenous concretions. In the Atlantic Iberian Peninsula,L. stictiformehas also been reported based on subtidal collections showing the characteristic morphology described for this species. Recent studies uncovered a diverse complex of cryptic species from the Mediterranean Sea assigned toL. stictiforme. Thereafter, the Atlantic Iberian collections have been re-assessed with the aim of clarifying its taxonomic status. Based on molecular (COI,psbA) and morphological data, the new speciesLithophyllum artabricumV.Peña, sp. nov. is described herein. Molecular phylogenetic analyses were congruent in delimiting the Atlantic Iberian collections as an independent lineage from the MediterraneanL. stictiformecomplex. Morpho-anatomical characters of the new species showed an overlap with those provided for the Mediterranean clades ofL. stictiforme. However,L. artabricumV.Peña, sp. nov. has a monomerous thallus construction whereas the Mediterranean taxa were mainly dimerous. Moreover,L. artabricumV.Peña, sp. nov. differs from other Atlantic EuropeanLithophyllumspecies by a combination of characters related to the external morphology consisting of single or superimposed lamellae, the monomerous construction, the conical shape of the canal pore of sporangial conceptacles, and by occurring only in subtidal bedrocks.Lithophyllum artabricumV.Peña, sp. nov. is at present known from northern Spain to northern Portugal. One collection ofL. stictiformefrom southern Portugal showed similarities withL. artabricumV.Peña, sp. nov.; however, DNA sequence data are necessary to confirm this record. Based on the evidence presented herein,L. stictiformeis removed from the flora of northern and northwestern Spain, and northern Portugal. The finding of cryptic diversity inL. stictiformesuggested that further reports of this species in warm and temperate waters should be re-assessed.</abstract>

Misleading historical nomenclature, such as the May-Thurner, pelvic congestion, and nutcracker syndromes, often fails to recognize the interrelationship of many pelvic symptoms and their underlying pathophysiology. Based on a perceived need, the American Vein and Lymphatic Society convened an international, multidisciplinary panel charged with the development of a discriminative classification instrument for PeVD. This instrument, the Symptoms-Varices-Pathophysiology (“SVP”) classification for PeVD, includes three domains—Symptoms (S), Varices (V), and Pathophysiology (P), with the pathophysiology domain encompassing the Anatomic (A), Hemodynamic (H), and Etiologic (E) features of the patient’s disease. An individual patient’s classification is designated as SVPA,H,E. For patients with pelvic origin lower extremity signs or symptoms, the SVP instrument is complementary to and should be used in conjunction with the Clinical-Etiologic-Anatomic-Physiologic (CEAP) classification. The SVP instrument accurately defines the diverse patient populations with PeVD, an important step in improving clinical decision making, developing disease-specific outcome measures and identifying homogenous patient populations for clinical trials.</abstract>

    <title>Reassessment of the type collections of Maslov’s species of Corallinales (Rhodophyta). I. species originally attributed to Lithophyllum and Melobesia</title>
    <year>2021</year>
    <authors>Juan C Braga, Davide Bassi, Elena Zakrevskaya, Eleonora Petrovna Radionova</authors>
    <abstract>This paper is part of a wider project for reassessing Maslov’s original collection of fossil calcareous algae with a modern taxonomic approach. Based on this collection, currently housed in the Geological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences of Moscow, Maslov described many taxa of calcareous algae of diverse ages from the former USSR in two monographs and several other papers from 1929 to 1973. As in other taxonomic publications from those decades, many of Maslov’s new species of fossil coralline algae were distinguished by only a few characters of questionable taxonomic significance; in addition, most of his work was published in Russian with limited illustrations. This study deals in particular with Maslov’s original preserved material of species attributed by him to the genera Lithophyllum and Melobesia (Corallinales, Rhodophyta). Our reassessment indicates that only the types of Lithophyllum duplex Maslov, and Hydrolithon corculumis (Maslov) comb. nov. (= Lithophyllum corculumis) show significant features justifying their use as species names in coralline algal taxonomy. The type of Lithophyllum microsporum Maslov is a gametangial plant that cannot be compared with the tetrasporangial plants used to delimit other coralline algal species within the Corallinaceae subfamily Lithophylloideae. Although they are validly published species names, the lack of significant characters in the preserved types prevents any confident placement of “Melobesia (Lithoporella) badjii”, “Lithophyllum conocristatum”, “L. dioscurensum”, “M. (L.) karpatica” “L. (Tenarea?) lithothamnioides”, “L. pavlovii”, “L. platticarpum”, “L. premoluccense var. cretacicum”, “L. senonicum”, “L. translucidum” in any defined generic or suprageneric taxon within the Corallinales.</abstract>

    <abstract>Lithophyllum okamuraeis one of the important encrusting coralline algae, which plays important roles as primary producer, carbonate sediment builder, and habitat provider in the marine ecosystems. In this study,L. okamuraewas collected from tropical coast of Sanya, and firstly described based on both detailed morph-anatomical characteristics and molecular studies of typic DNA sequences. The structure of the thalli ofL. okamuraewas pseudoparenchymatous construction with radially organized dimerous organizations in the crustose portion. The pseudoparenchymatous construction were composed of three parts, including 1 to 3 layers of epithelia cells which had flatten to round outermost walls, one layer of square or rectangular cells of the hypothallia and multiple layers of square or elongated rectangular peripheral cells. Palisade cells were observed, and the cells of the contiguous vegetative filaments were connected by secondary pit-connections with cell fusions absent. The carposporangial conceptacles, the spermatangial conceptacles, the bisporangial conceptacles and the tetrasporangial conceptacles were observed, and all these four kinds of conceptacles were uniporate. The spermatangial conceptacles were slightly convex and buried at shallow depths in the thalli tissues, and the carposporangial conceptacles and asexual conceptacles were protruding and conical. Phylogenetic studies based on DNA barcoding markers of 18S rDNA, COI, rbcL andpsbArevealed thatL. okamuraeclustered with the closest relation ofL. atlanticum, and formed a distinct branch. Based on the comparative anatomical features and the molecular data, the detailed description of the valid species ofL. okamuraewas firstly given in this study to provide theoretical basis for algae resources utilization and conservation in marine ecosystems.</abstract>

    <title>Effects of water temperature, light and nitrate on the growth of sporelings of the non-geniculate coralline alga Lithophyllum okamurae (Corallinales, Rhodophyta)</title>
    <year>2020</year>
    <authors>Sakie Yoshioka, Aki Kato, Kazuhiko Koike, Noboru Murase, Masasuke Baba, Lawrence M. Liao</authors>
    <abstract>Coralline algae in temperate waters commonly form an understory beneath canopy-forming seaweeds. They are sometimes dominant on barren grounds where seaweed forests have declined. The early life history stage such as a sporeling is a crucial phase for the initial establishment and persistence of the seaweed population. Therefore, the optimum and vital growth conditions for sporelings of these coralline algae under various environmental factors must be defined. We investigated using laboratory culture the effects of water temperature, light, and nitrate levels on the growth of sporelings of a non-geniculate coralline algaLithophyllum okamuraewhich is commonly found in the temperate Western Pacific. The optimum temperature for growth of the sporelings was 20 °C, with the growth rate decreased above this temperature. The highest temperatureL. okamuraesporelings survived was 30 °C. The saturating irradiance (photosynthetic photon flux density) for the growth of the sporelings was inferred as approximately 130 μmol photons m−2s−1with photoinhibition observed at a greater irradiance, which was similarly seen in other coralline algae grown in shade conditions, indicating thatL. okamuraehad adapted to such conditions. The initial slope of the growth rate versus nitrate concentration (Vmax/Ks) of the sporelings was lower than that of other coralline species, but was similar to values for other macroalgae. These results indicate thatL. okamuraeis not more tolerant than other macroalgae under these mentioned growth conditions; hence, this species might respond similarly as other macroalgae against future environmental changes.</abstract>

    <abstract>Computation in neuronal assemblies is putatively reflected in the excitatory and inhibitory cycles of activation distributed throughout the brain. In speech and language processing, coordination of these cycles resulting in phase synchronization has been argued to reflect the integration of information on different timescales (e.g. segmenting acoustics signals to phonemic and syllabic representations; (Giraud and Poeppel 2012 Nat. Neurosci. 15, 511 (doi:10.1038/nn.3063)). A natural extension of this claim is that phase synchronization functions similarly to support the inference of more abstract higher-level linguistic structures (Martin 2016 Front. Psychol. 7, 120; Martin and Doumas 2017 PLoS Biol. 15, e2000663 (doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2000663); Martin and Doumas. 2019 Curr. Opin. Behav. Sci. 29, 77–83 (doi:10.1016/j.cobeha.2019.04.008)). Hale et al. (Hale et al. 2018 Finding syntax in human encephalography with beam search. arXiv 1806.04127 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04127)) showed that syntactically driven parsing decisions predict electroencephalography (EEG) responses in the time domain; here we ask whether phase synchronization in the form of either inter-trial phrase coherence or cross-frequency coupling (CFC) between high-frequency (i.e. gamma) bursts and lower-frequency carrier signals (i.e. delta, theta), changes as the linguistic structures of compositional meaning (viz., bracket completions, as denoted by the onset of words that complete phrases) accrue. We use a naturalistic story-listening EEG dataset from Hale et al. to assess the relationship between linguistic structure and phase alignment. We observe increased phase synchronization as a function of phrase counts in the delta, theta, and gamma bands, especially for function words. A more complex pattern emerged for CFC as phrase count changed, possibly related to the lack of a one-to-one mapping between ‘size’ of linguistic structure and frequency band—an assumption that is tacit in recent frameworks. These results emphasize the important role that phase synchronization, desynchronization, and thus, inhibition, play in the construction of compositional meaning by distributed neural networks in the brain. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Towards mechanistic models of meaning composition’.</abstract>

    <title>Mediterranean &lt;i&gt;Lithophyllum stictiforme&lt;/i&gt; (Corallinales, Rhodophyta) is a genetically diverse species complex: implications for species circumscription, biogeography and conservation of coralligenous habitats</title>

    <abstract>Lithophyllum  species in the Mediterranean Sea function as algal bioconstructors, contributing to the formation of biogenic habitats such as coralligenous concretions. In such habitats, thalli of  Lithophyllum , consisting of crusts or lamellae with entire or lobed margins, have been variously referred to as either one species,  L. stictiforme , or two species,  L. stictiforme  and  L. cabiochiae , in the recent literature. We investigated species diversity and phylogenetic relationships in these algae by sequencing three markers ( psb A and  rbc L genes,  cox 2,3 spacer), in conjunction with methods for algorithmic delimitation of species ( ABGD  and  GMYC ). Mediterranean subtidal  Lithophyllum  belong to a well‐supported lineage, hereby called the  L. stictiforme  complex, which also includes two species described from the Atlantic,  L. lobatum  and  L. searlesii . Our results indicate that the  L. stictiforme  complex consists of at least 13 species. Among the Mediterranean species, some are widely distributed and span most of the western and central Mediterranean, whereas others appear to be restricted to specific localities. These patterns are interpreted as possibly resulting from allopatric speciation events that took place during the Messinian Salinity Crisis and subsequent glacial periods. A partial  rbc L sequence from the lectotype of  L. stictiforme  unambiguously indicates that this name applies to the most common subtidal  Lithophyllum  in the central Mediterranean. We agree with recent treatments that considered  L. cabiochiae  and  L. stictiforme  conspecific. The diversity of  Lithophyllum  in Mediterranean coralligenous habitats has been substantially underestimated, and future work on these and other Mediterranean corallines should use identifications based on  DNA  sequences.</abstract>

    <abstract>Periodontitis, a consequence of persistent bacterial infection and chronic inflammation, has been suggested to predict coronary heart disease (CHD). The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of periodontitis on HDL structure and antiatherogenic function in cholesterol efflux in vitro. HDL was isolated from 30 patients (age 43.6 ± 6.1 years, mean ± SD) with periodontitis before and after (3.2 ± 1.4 months) periodontal treatment. The capacity of HDL for cholesterol efflux from macrophages (RAW 264.7), HDL composition, and key proteins of HDL metabolism were determined. After periodontal treatment, phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) activity was 6.2% (P &lt; 0.05) lower, and serum HDL cholesterol concentration, PLTP mass, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity were 10.7% (P &lt; 0.001), 7.1% (P = 0.078), and 19.4% (P &lt; 0.001) higher, respectively. The mean HDL2/HDL3 ratio increased from 2.16 ± 0.87 to 3.56 ± 0.48 (P &lt; 0.05). HDL total phospholipid mass and sphingomyelin-phosphatidylcholine ratio were 7.4% (P &lt; 0.05) and 36.8% (P &lt; 0.001) higher, respectively. The HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux tended to be higher after periodontal treatment; interestingly, this increase was significant (P &lt; 0.05) among patients whose C-reactive protein decreased (53.7% reduction, P = 0.015) and who were positive by PCR for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. These results suggest that periodontitis causes similar, but milder, changes in HDL metabolism than those that occur during the acute-phase response and that periodontitis may diminish the antiatherogenic potency of HDL, thus increasing the risk for CHD.</abstract>

    <abstract>Проведена оценка динамики численности, внешнего вида клеток, флуоресценции хлоропласта и зеленой автофлуоресценции клеток (ЗАФ) динофлагелляты Prorocentrum foraminosum при воздействии тяжелых металлов: кадмия Cd2+, никеля Ni2+ и свинца Pb2+ в концентрациях 10 и 20 мкг/л. Показано, что все металлы в изученных концентрациях оказали ингибирующее влияние на численность клеток: наименьшее воздействие оказал Cd2+. Морфологически клетки не изменялись при воздействии Cd2+, Pb2+, а при добавлении Ni2+ отмечена деформация клеток. Флуоресценция хлоропласта изменялась при воздействии металлов, за исключением Cd2+. В целом, ЗАФ не изменялась при наличии в среде Cd2+, увеличивалась при добавлении Ni2+, снижалась – Pb2+. Предложено использовать ЗАФ для экспресс оценки токсичности веществ и качества вод.

    <title>Assessment of Coralline Species Diversity in the European Coasts Supported by Sequencing of Type Material: The Case Study of&lt;i&gt;Lithophyllum nitorum&lt;/i&gt;(Corallinales, Rhodophyta)</title>

    <authors>Viviana peña, Jazmin J. Hernandez-Kantun, Walter H. Adey, Line Le Gall</authors>
    <abstract>A constant effort in sequencing an extensive number of specimens originating from comprehensive sampling had return an unprecedented amount of information fostering our understanding of diversity, evolution and distribution of coralline algae; however, many sequences lack reliable assignation of a taxonomic name, specially at the species level. Recently, the sequencing of type material allowed to bridge this gap by providing a direct link between the DNA sequence and the type bearing name. For instance, in the genusLithophyllum,the identity of three species, generally abundant along the European Atlantic and the Mediterranean, was demonstrated by including sequences of the type material. Nevertheless, for less conspicious species, such asLithophyllum nitorum,data are still needed to assess distribution, anatomy, phylogenetic affinities and taxonomic status. Using DNA sequences recovered from the type material ofL. nitorum, further recent collections were resolved as conspecific and used to improve the description and refine the distribution of this species.Lithophyllum nitorumconsisted of subtidal, thin crusts overgrowing fragments of dead maerl, pebbles and drifted fragments of fishing lines. The presence of uniporate conceptacles markedly protruding can be considered an external morphological feature useful to identifyL. nitorumfrom other subtidalLithophyllumspecies with similar habitat.Lithophyllum nitorumis reported for the Mediterranean Sea and confirmed in the North East Atlantic, a similar distribution as forL. incrustansandL. hibernicum.</abstract>

    <title>Antibiofilm and antioxidant activities of extracts of crustose coralline alga
Lithophyllum sp. from the central Red Sea, Saudi Arabia</title>
    <year>2017</year>
    <authors>Abdulmohsin A. Al-Sofyani Abdulmohsin A. Al-Sofyani</authors>
    <abstract>In this study, the antibiofilm and antioxidant activities of the crustose coralline alga (CCA) Lithophyllum sp. collected from the central Red sea was investigated. The dried CCA samples were extracted with hot water and methanol. Both extracts were tested against marine biofilm forming bacteria to assess the antibiofilm activity. Results showed that methanol extract of the CCA inhibited bacterial growth considerably. The water extract revealed higher antioxidant activity than the methanol extract. The FT-IR spectrum of the CCA showed the presence of functional groups like alkanes, alcohol, carboxylic acid, ethers and esters. In general, results of the present study indicated that CCA produces bioactive compounds, which can inhibit the attachment of unwanted marine bacteria on their surfaces.</abstract>

    <title>Elemental variability in the coralline alga &lt;i&gt;Lithophyllum yemenense&lt;/i&gt; as an archive of past climate in the Gulf of Aden (NW Indian Ocean)</title>
    <year>2017</year>
    <authors>Annalisa Caragnano, Daniela Basso, David Storz, Dorrit E. Jacob, Federica Ragazzola, Francesca Benzoni, Eric Dutrieux</authors>
    <abstract>This study presents the first algal thallus (skeleton) archive of Asian monsoon strength and Red Sea influence in the Gulf of Aden. Mg/Ca, Li/Ca, and Ba/Ca were measured in  Lithophyllum yemenense  from Balhaf (Gulf of Aden) using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and Mg/Ca ratio oscillation was used to reconstruct the chronology (34 y). Oscillations of element rates corresponding to the algal growth between 1974 and 2008 were compared with recorded climate and oceanographic variability. During this period, sea surface temperatures ( SST ) in Balhaf recorded a warming trend of 0.55°C, corresponding to an increase in Mg and Li content in the algal thallus of 2.1 mol‐% and 1.87 μmol‐%, respectively.  Lithophyllum yemenense  recorded decadal  SST  variability by Li/Ca, and the influence of the Pacific El‐Niño Southern Oscillation on the  NW  Indian Ocean climate system by Ba/Ca. Additionally, algal Mg/Ca, Li/Ca, and Ba/Ca showed strong and significant correlations with All Indian Rainfall in the decadal range indicating that these proxies can be useful for tracking variability in the Indian monsoon system, possibly due to changes of the surface wind system, with deep water upwelling in summer, and a distinct seasonality.</abstract>

    <title>Genetic and morphological variation in an ecosystem engineer, &lt;i&gt;Lithophyllum byssoides&lt;/i&gt; (Corallinales, Rhodophyta)</title>
    <year>2016</year>
    <authors>Laura Pezzolesi, Annalisa Falace, Sara Kaleb, Jazmin J. Hernandez‐Kantun, Carlo Cerrano, Fabio Rindi</authors>
    <abstract>Lithophyllum byssoides  is a common coralline alga in the intertidal zone of Mediterranean coasts, where it produces biogenic concretions housing a high algal and invertebrate biodiversity. This species is an ecosystem engineer and is considered a target for conservation efforts, but designing effective conservation strategies currently is impossible due to lack of information about its population structure. The morphological and molecular variation of  L. byssoides  was investigated using morphoanatomy and  DNA  sequences ( psb A and  cox 2,3) obtained from populations at 15 localities on the Italian and Croatian coasts.  Lithophyllum byssoides  exhibited a high number of haplotypes (31  psb A haplotypes and 24  cox 2,3 haplotypes) in the central Mediterranean. The  psb A and  cox 2,3 phylogenies were congruent and showed seven lineages. For most of these clades, the distribution was limited to one or a few localities, but one of them (clade 7) was widespread across the central Mediterranean, spanning the main biogeographic boundaries recognized in this area. The central Mediterranean populations formed a lineage separate from Atlantic samples;  psb A pair‐wise divergences suggested that recognition of Atlantic and Mediterranean  L. byssoides  as different species may be appropriate. The central Mediterranean haplotype patterns of  L. byssoides  were interpreted as resulting from past climatic events in the hydrogeological history of the Mediterranean Sea. The high haplotype diversity and the restricted spatial distribution of the seven lineages suggest that individual populations should be managed as independent units.</abstract>

    <title>Mineralogical response of the Mediterranean crustose coralline alga
&lt;i&gt;Lithophyllum cabiochae&lt;/i&gt; to near-future ocean acidification and warming</title>
    <year>2016</year>
    <authors>Merinda C. Nash, Sophie Martin, Jean-Pierre Gattuso</authors>
    <abstract>Abstract. Red calcareous coralline algae are thought to be among the organisms most vulnerable to ocean acidification due to the high solubility of their magnesium calcite skeleton. Although skeletal mineralogy is proposed to change as CO2 and temperature continue to rise, there is currently very little information available on the response of coralline algal carbonate mineralogy to near-future changes in pCO2 and temperature. Here we present results from a 1-year controlled laboratory experiment to test mineralogical responses to pCO2 and temperature in the Mediterranean crustose coralline alga (CCA) Lithophyllum cabiochae. Our results show that Mg incorporation is mainly constrained by temperature (+1 mol % MgCO3 for an increase of 3 °C), and there was no response to pCO2. This suggests that L. cabiochae thalli have the ability to buffer their calcifying medium against ocean acidification, thereby enabling them to continue to deposit magnesium calcite with a significant mol % MgCO3 under elevated pCO2. Analyses of CCA dissolution chips showed a decrease in Mg content after 1 year for all treatments, but this was affected neither by pCO2 nor by temperature. Our findings suggest that biological processes exert a strong control on calcification on magnesium calcite and that CCA may be more resilient under rising CO2 than previously thought. However, previously demonstrated increased skeletal dissolution with ocean acidification will still have major consequences for the stability and maintenance of Mediterranean coralligenous habitats.</abstract>

    <title>Light and temperature requirements for survival, growth and reproduction of the crustose coralline &lt;i&gt;Lithophyllum stictaeforme&lt;/i&gt; from the Mediterranean Sea</title>
    <year>2016</year>
    <authors>Conxi Rodríguez-Prieto</authors>
    <abstract>Abstract                  Laboratory experiments were set up in order to assess light and temperature requirements for survival, growth and reproduction of specimens of  Lithophyllum stictaeforme  collected at 30–35 m depth in the NW Mediterranean. Three replicates were grown in a variety of regimes, with temperature varying from 10 to 26°C, photoperiod from 8:16 to 16:8 h light:dark, and irradiance from 5 to 75 μmol photons m -2  s -1 . Other experiments were designed to imitate seasonal changes of temperature and photoperiod, and were maintained successively in temperature and photoperiod conditions of winter, spring, summer and autumn, and each set of conditions was combined with irradiances of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 75 μmol photons m -2  s -1 . Survival of thalli depended on both irradiance and temperature, with a strong interaction between these factors. The longest survival of thalli (&amp;gt;5 years) was observed at 20 μmol photons m -2  s -1  combined with 10–12°C and an 8:16 h light:dark regime, while the lowest survival (&amp;lt;0.6 years) was observed at 75 μmol photons m -2  s -1  combined with 24–26°C and a 16:8 h light-dark regime. No marginal extension was observed in any of the culture conditions examined. The time required for reproductive structures to mature was always &amp;lt;1.5 years and was correlated with thallus survival; it was dependent on temperature/photoperiod and specimens living at higher temperatures released their reproductive cells earlier. In the culture conditions that simulated seasonal changes, conceptacles matured in autumn, in agreement with the behaviour of field specimens, except at 75 μmol photons m -2  s -1 , when they matured earlier due to irradiance stress.</abstract>

    <title>Parameterization of the response of calcification to temperature and pCO2 in the coral Acropora pulchra and the alga Lithophyllum kotschyanum</title>
    <year>2016</year>
    <authors>S. Comeau, R. C. Carpenter, C. A. Lantz, P. J. Edmunds</authors>
    <abstract>The response of tropical corals and calcifying algae to ocean acidification (OA) and warming has received much attention in the past decade. However, most studies have evaluated the response of organisms to two or three temperature treatments, which does not allow the functional relationship between calcification and temperature under ambient and futurepCO2to be determined. This study tested the hypothesis that the relationship between calcification and temperature is affected by OA in the coralAcropora pulchraand the calcified algaLithophyllum kotschyanum. Pieces of each organism were incubated under five (24–30 °C) or six (24–31.5 °C) temperatures crossed with twopCO2levels (400 and 1000 μatm), and calcification was assessed in trials conducted in the spring and summer. The response of coral calcification to temperature was a positive asymmetric parabola with a maximum at ~28 °C under bothpCO2levels and in both seasons; the effects ofpCO2on calcification were largest at ~28 °C and lowest in both cool and warm temperatures. In contrast, calcification of the alga at both levels ofpCO2was unaffected by temperature in spring, but declined linearly with temperature in summer. This study demonstrates that the calcification response of coral reef organisms to the crossed effect of warming and OA is complex and cannot be fully assessed without using multiple temperature treatments that are ecologically relevant.</abstract>

    <abstract>DNA  sequences from type material in the nongeniculate coralline genus  Lithophyllum  were used to unambiguously link some European species names to field‐collected specimens, thus providing a great advance over morpho‐anatomical identifi‐cation. In particular, sequence comparisons of  rbc L,  COI  and  psb A genes from field‐collected specimens allowed the following conclusion: the generitype species,  L. incrustans , occurs mostly as subtidal rhodoliths and crusts on both Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts, and not as the common,  NE  Atlantic, epilithic, intertidal crust reported in the literature. The heterotypic type material of  L. hibernicum  was narrowed to one rhodolith belonging in  Lithophyllum . As well as occurring as a subtidal rhodolith,  L. hibernicum  is a common, epilithic and epizoic crust in the intertidal zone from Ireland south to Mediterranean France. A set of four features distinguished  L. incrustans  from  L. hibernicum , including epithallial cell diameter, pore canal shape of sporangial conceptacles and sporangium height and diameter. An  rbc L sequence of the lectotype of  Lithophyllum bathyporum , which was recently proposed to accommodate Atlantic intertidal collections of  L. incrustans , corresponded to a distinct taxon hitherto known only from Brittany as the subtidal, bisporangial, lectotype, but also occurs intertidally in Atlantic Spain. Specimens from Ireland and France morpho‐anatomically identified as  L. fasciculatum  and a specimen from Cornwall likewise identified as  L. duckerae  were resolved as  L. incrustans  and  L. hibernicum , respectively.</abstract>

    <title>The genus Lithophyllum in the north-western Indian Ocean, with description of  L. yemenense sp. nov., L. socotraense sp. nov., L. subplicatum comb. et stat. nov., and the resumed L. affine, L. kaiseri, and L. subreduncum (Rhodophyta, Corallinales)</title>

    <abstract>Based on literature, the genus Lithophyllum was represented in the whole Indian Ocean by 14 taxa, mostly in need of revision in a modern context. Molecular analyses integrated with morpho-anatomical comparisons between the recently revised type material of Lithophyllum kotschyanum Unger, and the related infraspecific taxa, lead to a resumption of L. affine, L. kaiseri, and L. subreduncum, and the description of L. socotraense sp. nov., L. yemenense sp. nov., and L. subplicatum comb. et stat. nov. Detailed accounts are provided for each species, including keys, along with information on synonymy, examined collections, distribution, habitat as well as sequence data of the 5’ end of the LSU from the type specimens. The anatomical features of the tetrasporangial conceptacle that were considered collectively diagnostic for species identification are: the mean diameter of the tetrasporangial conceptacles, the length of the pore-canal in the tetrasporangial conceptacles (with the number of cells in roof filaments), the occurrence of a depression at the top of the conceptacle roof in relation to the pore opening, and the number of cells from the floor of the tetrasporangial conceptacle chamber to the thallus surface. This study provides evidence of a previously unsuspected diversity within the Red Sea and NW Indian Ocean species of Lithophyllum.</abstract>

    <abstract>Coralline algae (Corallinophycidae, Rhodophyta) are primarily characterized by the impregnation of calcium carbonate (calcite) in their cell walls. To determine the systematic position of genera and species, researchers are increasingly combining anatomical studies with comparisons of DNA sequences. In the present study we have described the main representatives of the genus Lithophyllum in intertidal and subtidal habitats from the southern coast of Brazil based on anatomical studies, supported by molecular markers. Analyses were conducted on specimens collected from five sites along the coast of southern Brazil. Anatomical studies were carried out by light and scanning electron microscopy. Molecular studies were based on DNA barcoding markers (cox1; UPA) and SSU rDNA. Using comparative anatomical features, corroborated by the molecular data, we identified two taxonomic entities from the Brazilian coast: Lithophyllum margaritae, and we propose the new species Lithophyllum atlanticum.</abstract>

    <title>New Insights into the Genus Lithophyllum (Lithophylloideae, Corallinaceae, Corallinales) from Deepwater Rhodolith Beds Offshore the NW Gulf of Mexico</title>
    <year>2014</year>
    <authors>Joseph L. Richards, Paul W. Gabrielson, Suzanne Fredericq</authors>
    <abstract>Hard bank rhodolith beds at 45–80 m depth offshore Louisiana in the Northwestern Gulf of Mexico harbor a diverse community of non-geniculate coralline algae spanning multiple lineages including both rhodolith-forming (biogenic) taxa and others encrusting autogenic rhodoliths. Identifying these members of the Corallinales to the correct genus and species is an ongoing process because many available names need to be validated by comparison to historical type specimens. A phylogenetic analysis of concatenated plastid (psbA), nuclear (LSU rDNA), and mitochondrial (COI) DNA sequences of non-geniculate corallines belonging to the subfamily Lithophylloideae (Corallinaceae), including newly generated sequences from recently collected specimens dredged at Ewing and Sackett Banks following the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, reveals at least two distinct species of Lithophyllum sensu lato for the region. Scanning Electron Microscopy confirmed the presence of vegetative characters congruent with those for both Lithophyllum and Titanoderma. Lithophyllum is a newly reported genus for the northern Gulf of Mexico. The generic boundaries within the Lithophylloideae are addressed in light of possible evolutionary progenetic heterochrony that may have occurred within this subfamily.</abstract>

    <abstract>Coralline algae, the algal whitening phenomenon-causing seaweeds, are characterized by calcareous deposits in the cell wall. The viability of the coralline algae Lithophyllum yessoense and Corallina pilulifera was quantitated using a triphenyltetrazolium chloride assay and eight calcification inhibitors. Among these inhibitors, ferric citrate showed the strongest inhibition of coralline algae viability. The concentrations of ferric citrate conferring 50% inhibition were 1.7 and 3.8 mM for L. yessoense and C. pilulifera, respectively. Thus, at a specific concentration and in a localized area, ferric citrate may be used to prevent the blooming of coralline algae.</abstract>

    <title>The genus Lithophyllum (Lithophylloideae, Corallinaceae, Rhodophyta) in south-eastern Australia, with the description of L. riosmenae, sp. nov.</title>
    <year>2009</year>
    <authors>A. S. Harvey, Wm J. Woelkerling, A. J. K. Millar</authors>
    <abstract>The genus Lithophyllum (Lithophylloideae, Corallinaceae, Rhodophyta) is represented by six species in south-eastern Australia L. chamberlainianum Woelkerling &amp;amp; Campbell, L. corallinae (Crouan &amp;amp; Crouan) Heydrich, L. cuneatum Keats, L. pustulatum (Lamouroux) Foslie, L. riosmenae, sp. nov., and L. stictaeforme (Areschoug in Agardh) Hauck. Four of these taxa are commonly found in Australia, whereas L. cuneatum was previously known only from Fiji and L. riosmenae is newly described. Morphological and anatomical accounts are provided, including keys, information on distribution, nomenclature and habitat in south-eastern Australia. South-eastern Australian species are primarily delimited on characters relating to tetrasporangial conceptacles and the presence/absence of a semi-endophytic habit. Ten species of Lithophyllum are now confirmed to occur in Australia and their diagnostic characters are detailed. Confirmed Australian species of Lithophyllum are primarily delimited on characters relating to tetrasporangial conceptacles, the presence/absence of a semi-endophytic habit and the growth-form. Biogeographic comparisons between south-eastern Australia and other Australian biogeographic regions are also made. Eight species of Lithophyllum are known to occur in southern Australia, three in tropical eastern Australia and three in subtropical western Australia. Southern and south-eastern Australia show major overlap, with five species occurring in both regions. L. pustulatum and L. stictaeformae are widely distributed, having been confirmed to occur in eastern tropical, western subtropical, warm temperate and cold temperate waters within Australia.</abstract>

    <title>Lectotypifícation of Lithophyllum arcticum (Corallinales, Rhodophyta) and a study of its relationships within the Melobesioideae</title>
    <year>2008</year>
    <authors>A. Athanasiadis</authors>
    <abstract>Three separate collections of the type material of Kjellman's  Lithophyllum arcticum  are re‐examined and a lectotype is selected. It is confirmed that the thallus is unattached, at least 4.5 cm in diameter, composed of up to eight superimposed more or less discoidal lamellae, provided with concentric striations on the surface. Individual lamellae are usually 100 to 200 μm thick (reaching 1 mm), developing dorsally from the main thallus and expanding centrifugally. The internal organization is dorsiventral with a polystromatic hypothallium, giving rise to an ascending perithallium with small subepithallial initials and rectangular (in TS) epithallial cells. It is found that patches of coaxial‐like growth occur sporadically in the hypothallium and the perithallium, and that ventral lamellae may grow back‐to‐back. Somatic cells exhibit both large and narrow cell fusions. Pore plates of the raised multiporate conceptacles are slightly sunken to flattened and perforated by 16 to 31 pores. Pore canals are conical (narrowing towards the top) and are bordered by filaments composed of both undifferentiated and slender‐elongate cells. Old conceptacles are overgrown by vegetative filaments and empty chambers are embedded in the perithallium. Collectively these features indicate that  L. arcticum  belongs to the subfamily Melobesioideae. The development of an unattached‐superimposed thallus, patches of coaxial growth, short subepithallial initials and specialized pore cells suggest a position either in  Mesophyllum , or in an amended  Leptophytum  to include even species with coaxial patches and unattached‐superimposed habit (characters presently segregating  Leptophytum  from  Synarthrophytorn ). The holotype of  Lithophyllum zonatum  from East‐Finnmark, previously considered to be related to  L. arcticum , is re‐examined and shown to belong to a different species. A previous Arctic record of  Mesophyllum lichenoides  from Spitsbergen is abolished, and thus the disjunct distribution of I.  arcticum  in relation to  Mesophyllum  suggests a position in the  Synarthrophyton‐Leptophytum  complex which shows a bipolar to temperate distribution.</abstract>

    <title>The taxonomic status of Lithophyllum stìctaeforme (Rhodophyta, Corallinales) and its generic position in light of phylogenetic considerations</title>
    <year>2008</year>
    <authors>A. Athanasiadis</authors>
    <abstract>The type of Lithophyllum stìctaeforme (Areschoug) Hauck (‵ Melobesia stictaeformis Areschoug in J. Agardh) is re‐examined and shown to be conspecific with a common Mediterranean foliose coralline recently recognized as Lithophyllum frondosum (Dufour) Furnari, Cormaci et Alongi (‵ Melobesia frondosa Dufour) and previously known by the misapplied name Lithophyllum (Pseudolithophyllum) expansum Philippi. The generic position of the species in Lithophyllum or Pseudolithophyllum is phylogenetically examined, in the Hennigian sense. It is shown that secondary perithallial outgrowths (‘faux hypothalle’) may represent a synapomorphy for these genera that traditionally have been segregated from each other by the presence, respectively absence, of a coaxial ‘faux hypothalle’. Recognition of both Lithophyllum and Pseudolithophyllum by virtue of a single character in its two states (absent vs. present) is however not tenable, if these genera are considered to be sister‐taxa.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of temperature on photosynthesis, growth and calcification rates of the free-living coralline alga Lithophyllum margaritae</title>
    <year>2007</year>
    <authors>DL Steller, JM Hernandez-Ayón, R Riosmena-Rodríguez, A Cabello-Pasini</authors>
    <abstract>Rhodolith beds are the dominant submerged calcifying aquatic vegetation in some coastal marine environments worldwide but few quantitative data are available regarding their physiology. In the Gulf of California (Mexico), Lithophyllum margaritae (Rhodophyta, Corallinaceae) is the most abundant nongeniculate, rhodolith-forming coralline species. Over their gulf-wide distribution, rhodoliths are exposed to a wide range of seasonal temperatures (~8–32ºC). The effect of changes in temperature on the photosynthetic and calcification rates of this species is unknown. We therefore evaluated the effect of temperature (10–30ºC) on the photosynthetic and calcification rates of L. margaritae rhodoliths in the lab and examined the effect of seasonal changes in temperature on growth rates in the field. Photosynthetic rates were evaluated polarographically and calcification rates were evaluated in the lab using both the buoyant weight technique and total alkalinity method, and in the field through alizarin staining. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that these three methods are used simultaneously to evaluate growth rates in coralline algae. Photosynthetic, calcification and growth rates showed wide fluctuations as a result of laboratory or field temperature. Photosynthetic (Pmax) and respiratory rates both increased five-fold as incubation temperature increased to 25–30ºC. Similarly, calcification rates in the lab and growth rates in the field increased with higher temperatures. The lab data suggest that rhodolith growth is seasonally regulated by seawater temperature. The buoyant weight and total alkalinity techniques for determining calcification rate were comparable at low temperatures, but variability increased with temperature and this will be examined in further studies. Field growth rates, presented as apical tip extension, were significantly higher in summer (5.02 ± 1.16 mm yr–1) than in winter (0.83 ± 0.16 mm yr–1), supporting the lab results. The strong effects of temperature on photosynthetic, calcification and growth rates of Lithophyllum margaritae in the Gulf of California suggest that changes in sea surface temperature directly regulate bed production.</abstract>

    <title>An account of Pleistocene species of Lithophyllum (Corallinaceae, Rhodophyta) from Sicily (Southern Italy)</title>
    <year>2007</year>
    <authors>Raffaella Di Geronimo</authors>
    <abstract>The genus Lithophyllum PHILIPPI, 1837 (Corallinaceae, Rhodophyta) includes several species which are common and widespread from the Cretaceous to the Recent. The oldest fossil record from Italy is referred to the Cretaceous; subsequent records are mostly from Oligo-Miocene sediments. Only two species of Lithophyllum (Lithophyllum racemus and Lithophyllum microcarpum) were recorded from the Pleistocene of Italy. In the present work, Pleistocene Corallinales assemblages, from different outcrops of south-eastern Sicily (Italy), have been examined allowing four Lithophyllum species (L. grandiusculum, L. nitorum, L. racemus, L. stictaeforme) to be distinguished, all of them presently living in the Mediterranean Sea. Morphological and systematic accounts are provided for each species applying features which are used for living material. Moreover, the present-day geographical distribution and ecological interpretation of these species as well as their stratigraphic distribution are reported.</abstract>

    <title>Fine structure of deep‐layer sloughing and epithallial regeneration in &lt;i&gt;Lithophyllum neoatalayense&lt;/i&gt; (Corallinales, Rhodophyta)</title>
    <year>2006</year>
    <authors>Curt M. Pueschel, Derek W. Keats</authors>
    <abstract>SUMMARY  Transmission electron microscopic study of  Lithophyllum neoatalayense  Masaki demonstrated that this alga used two mechanisms by which it sloughed cells from its surface. Epithallial filaments, produced by a layer of underlying initial cells, were two to four cells long. Terminal epithallial cells, those closest to the thallus surface, underwent senescence and shedding as previously described for other coralline algae. In addition, deep‐layer sloughing occurred. During this process, which is known for only one other coralline alga, cell death occurred uniformly within a surface layer 40‐50 μm thick. No pathogens or evidence of mechanical damage was detected. The zone of dead cells included the epithallial layer, the layer of initial cells, and some cortex cells beneath the initials. Pit plugs connecting living and dead cells at the edge of the necrotic zone were sealed by wall material deposited by the surviving cells, but cells within the necrotic zone showed no evidence of sealed pit plugs. The outermost surviving cells became new initial cells, which then divided to form new epithallial cells. Regeneration of the epithallial layer occurred before the thick layer of dead cells peeled away. The extensive deep shedding of both epithallial and initial cells in  L. neoatalayense  and the effectiveness of regeneration from cortex cells challenge the assumption that protection of initial cells is an important function of epithallial cells.</abstract>

    <authors>Derek W. Keats</authors>
    <abstract>SUMMARY  A new species of semi‐endophytic coralline alga,  Lithophyllum cuneatum  (Corallinaceae: Lithophylloideae), is described from Fiji. The species is characterized by a wedge‐like thallus that is partially buried in the thallus of the host coralline,  Hydrolithon onkodes  (Heydrich) Penrose et Woelkerling or occasionally  Neogoniolithon  sp., and that appears at the surface of the host as a small pustule that is usually paler in color than the host. The thallus consists of erect filaments that are derived from a single cell. The basal cell, when visible, is non‐palisade, and areas of bistratose margin are absent. Cells of contiguous erect filaments are joined by secondary pit connections. Epithallial cells are present in 2–3 layers, and individual trichocytes are common. Gametangial plants are dioecious. Male conceptacles have simple spermatangial systems that are confined to the floors of their elliptical chambers. Carposporangial conceptacles contain 5–8 celled gonimoblast filaments that are borne at the margin of a more‐or‐less discoid fusion cell, and so occupy the periphery of the elliptical conceptacle chambers. Tetrasporangial conceptacles are uniporate, with roofs formed from peripheral filaments, and chambers lack a central columella of sterile filaments. Despite its semi‐endophytic nature, haustorial cells are absent, and plastids and pigmentation are present.</abstract>

    <abstract>A study was made to investigate possible formation by the crustose coralline algaLithophyllum yessoenseof multiple allelopathic-related substances against the settlement and germination of spores of various seaweeds. Seven different solvents (n-hexane, diethyl ether, acetone, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, methanol, distilled water) and seawater were used to obtain crude extracts and secretory exudates from the coralline alga. The extracts and the algal conditioned seawater were tested for inhibitory activity against the settlement and germination of spores from 17 species representing 15 genera. Spore settlement of 14 species was inhibited over 90% by one or more extracts of the six organic solvents and conditioned seawater. The germination of spores from 13 species was inhibited by one or more extracts of all seven solvents and conditioned seawater. The species where spore settlement was not significantly affected showed strong inhibition of germination, andvice versa.</abstract>

    <title>GENETIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TWO GROWTH‐FORMS OF &lt;i&gt;LITHOPHYLLUM MARGARITAE&lt;/i&gt; (RHODOPHYTA) IN BAJA CALIFORNIA SUR, MEXICO&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;</title>
    <year>2002</year>
    <authors>Timothy N. Schaeffer, G. Jason Smith, Michael S. Foster, Anthony DeTomaso</authors>
    <abstract>Unattached, nongeniculate, coralline algae or rhodoliths exhibit a range of morphological variability seemingly dependent on environmental factors. Rhodoliths have an extensive fossil record, and environmentally dependent characteristics make them potentially reliable paleoindicators. Species of the rhodolith‐forming genus  Lithophyllum  Philippi in Baja California Sur, Mexico were recently consolidated into one species. Under the new classification,  L. margaritae  (Hariot) Heydrich consists of several growth forms presumably reflecting local environmental conditions. We examined the genetic structure of four populations of this species using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) to characterize the extent of genetic variation associated with foliose and fruticose growth forms. AFLP band sharing analysis revealed that foliose growth forms exhibited consistently higher intrapopulation similarities (0.75–0.85) than fruticose growth forms (similarity range, 0.55–0.67). This trend was also evident in comparisons of geographically isolated populations. These data indicate that the two morphologies are genetically distinct and that genetic exchange between foliose and fruticose growth forms of  L. margaritae  may be limited. Consequently, rhodolith growth forms appear to be the result of an interplay between both genetic makeup and environmental conditions.</abstract>

    <abstract>The problem of the altitude of contemporary sea level is an important one for the field archaeologist in coastal areas of the northwestern Mediterranean basin, where sedimentary and archaeological indicators are scarce or lack accuracy. Littoral algal rims built up by Lithophyllum lichenoides may be used as accurate biological sea level indicators on rocky coasts. Submersed and eroded remains are levelled and dated by radiocarbon ; a subsequent plotting of age/depth data allows a reconstitution of the sea level rise during the last four millenia. It appears from our study that, on rocky coasts of western Provence, relative sea level rose during the first millenium before Christ (approximately between 3000 and 2000 BP in radiocarbon years) with an average rate of 0,4 mm/year from - 100 cm under present datum to about - 60 cm, then slowed off to an average rate of 0,24 mm/year between - 68 cm and present datum from 1500 BP onwards. This apparent sea level rise represents the combined effect of eustatic rise and local tectonic components. Regional differences between western Provence, alpine and pyrenean regions, as well as local discrepancies may be noted.</abstract>

    <title>Grazing on the Crustose Coralline Alga Lithophyllum yessoense by the Sea Urchin Styongylocentrotus nudus and the Limpet Acmaea pallida</title>
    <year>1992</year>
    <authors>DAISUKE FUJITA</authors>
    <abstract>Lithophyllum yessoense, a dominant crustose coralline alga on lsoyake (urchin-dominated barren) ground in southwestern Hokkaido, was experimentally fed to the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus nudus (3cm in test diameter) and the limpet Acmaea pallida (2cm in shell length) in the laboratory. Grazing marks of the urchin were composed of pentagonally-arranged five strips, and scattered on the crust surface. The wound was 0.01mm deep within sacrificial epithallium, and crust surface of 0.20mm2was removed by one biting. The limpet grazed more densely and deeply (0.04mm) enough to remove distal columnar cells as well as epithallial cells. Crust surface of 0.43mm2was removed by one biting. The urchin-grazing marks (shallow wounds) became vague by the usual production of epithallial cells in 5 days. On the contrary, the limpet-grazing marks (deep wounds) recovered by regeneration of the intact columnar cells in 10 days. The production of epithallial cells and the regeneration from columnar cells must be the important nature to elucidate the vigorous coverage of this species under high urchin-grazing pressure in the Isoyake ground.</abstract>

    <title>Physical characteristics of artificial nori made from Ptilophora pinnatifida and Moringa oleifera leaves</title>
    <year>2020</year>
    <authors>R Andriani, A Wulansari, E K Dewi, A H Husen</authors>
    <abstract>Abstract                  Artificial nori is a potential alternative to fulfil the need of nori (dried  Porphyra)  in Indonesia.  Ptilophora pinnatifida  naturally does not have green colour.  Moringa oleifera  leaves can give natural green colour to the artificial nori made from  Ptilophora pinnatifida . The aim of this study was to produce an artificial nori which had a close physical characteristics as the commercial nori. This study was an experimental research using the concentrate of  Moringa oleifera  leaves as variable. The concentrate was consisted of 4%, 6%, and 8% (w/w) of  Moringa oleifera  leaves. The artificial nori made from mixture of  Ptilophora pinnatifida  and  Moringa oleifera  leaves were analized it’s colours (L, a, and b), thickness, tensile strength, and elongation. The result showed, the artificial nori with 8% addition of  Moringa oleifera  leaves had the closest physical characteristics as the commercial nori. It had 0.25 mm of thickness, 1.22 kg/cm 2  of tensile strength, 7.67% elongation, colour L 28.05, colour a 2.90, and colour b 10.31. The concentrate of  Moringa oleifera  significantly affected the colours, tensile strength, and elongation of the artificial nori, while the tickness was not significantly affected by the concentration of  Moringa oleifera .</abstract>

    <authors>Ga Hun Boo, Line Le Gall, Il Ki Hwang, Kathy Ann Miller, Sung Min Boo</authors>
    <abstract>The genus  Ptilophora  currently includes 16 species occurring mostly in subtidal habitats of the Indo‐Pacific Ocean, but its global diversity and biogeography are poorly understood. We analyzed mitochondrial  cox 1, plastid  rbc L and plastid  psb A sequences from specimens collected in southern Madagascar during the 2010 Atimo Vatae expedition and studied their morphologies. Both morphological and molecular data sets demonstrated the presence of five species in southern Madagascar:  Ptilophora hildebrandtii ,  P. pterocladioides , and three new species described here,  P. aureolusa ,  P. malagasya , and  P. spongiophila .  Ptilophora aureolusa  is distinguished by its compound pinnae with uniformly spaced pinnules.  Ptilophora malagasya  has an indistinct midrib and irregularly spaced pinnules.  Ptilophora spongiophila , heavily coated with sponges, has cylindrical to flattened main axes, lateral and surface proliferations, and spatulate tetrasporangial sori. The species of  Ptilophora  found in Madagascar are endemic, except  P. hildebrandtii , which also occurs in eastern Africa.  Ptilophora  comprises four phylogenetic groups that map to eastern Australia, Japan, western Australia/Southeast Asia/Madagascar/eastern Africa, and Madagascar/eastern Africa/Aegean Sea. Biogeographical analysis revealed that the ancestor of  Ptilophora  originated in Australia, but most of the species radiated from Madagascar.</abstract>

    <title>Ptilophora variabilis Hartig, 1968, bona species, and description of Ptilophora nebrodensis sp. n. from Sicily (Lepidoptera, Notodontidae)</title>

    <authors>MARCO INFUSINO, AXEL HAUSMANN, STEFANO SCALERCIO</authors>
    <abstract>In this paper, we redescribe Ptilophora plumigera variabilis Hartig, 1968 and raise it to species rank. Furthermore we describe Ptilophora nebrodensis sp. n. from Sicily, as the third European species belonging to the genus Ptilophora Stephens, 1828. These two species are allopatric vicariants of Ptilophora plumigera (Denis &amp;amp; Schiffermüller, 1775) respectively in Apennine Italy and Sicily. We present the differential features mainly concerning the morphology of genitalia and molecular data. Ptilophora variabilis shows a scattered distribution, generally very localized, whereas P. nebrodensis sp. n. is restricted to a few localities in the mountainous areas of North Sicily, being very rare. Both species predominantly inhabit forests in mountain areas, with occurrence of broadleaved trees, especially Acer spp. (Fam. Aceraceae).</abstract>

    <title>Hexose Oxidase-Mediated Hydrogen Peroxide as a Mechanism for the Antibacterial Activity in the Red Seaweed Ptilophora subcostata</title>
    <year>2016</year>
    <authors>Kimi Ogasawara, Kenji Yamada, Noriyuki Hatsugai, Chiaki Imada, Mikio Nishimura</authors>
    <abstract>Marine algae have unique defense strategies against microbial infection. However, their mechanisms of immunity remain to be elucidated and little is known about the similarity of the immune systems of marine algae and terrestrial higher plants. Here, we suggest a possible mechanism underlying algal immunity, which involves hexose oxidase (HOX)-dependent production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). We examined crude extracts from five different red algal species for their ability to prevent bacterial growth. The extract from one of these algae,Ptilophora subcostata, was particularly active and prevented the growth of gram-positive and -negative bacteria, which was completely inhibited by treatment with catalase. The extract did not affect the growth of either a yeast or a filamentous fungus. We partially purified fromP.subcostataan enzyme involved in its antibacterial activity, which shared 50% homology with the HOX of red seaweedChondrus crispus. In-gel carbohydrate oxidase assays revealed thatP.subcostataextract had the ability to produce H2O2in a hexose-dependent manner and this activity was highest in the presence of galactose. In addition,Bacillus subtilisgrowth was strongly suppressed nearP.subcostataalgal fronds on GYP agar plates. These results suggest that HOX plays a role inP.subcostataresistance to bacterial attack by mediating H2O2production in the marine environment.</abstract>

    <abstract>The notodontid genera Himeropteryx Staudindger, 1887 and Ptilophora Stephans, 1828 are both typical low-temperature flying taxa belonging to subfamily Ptilodontinae (Schintlmeister 2008). The former is a monotypic genus containing H. miraculosa Staudinger, 1887 from East Asia, and the latter encompasses six Old Word species. Ptilophora are well known Acer-feeders (Aceraceae) in the previous records (Nakatomi 1987; Schintlmeister 2008; Kobayashi 2011), while Himeropteryx miraculosa also feeds on Aesculus tuburinata (Aceraceae) and Carpinus japonica (Betulaceae) (Nakatomi, 1987). The population of Himeropteryx in Taiwan was first recorded and described by Okano (1969) as a subspecies yui of H. miraculosa based on one male specimen collected in the vicinity of Nengkuoshan (elevation ca. 3000m) in central Taiwan. Subsequently, this name combination was listed in Sugi (1992) but the reference year was erroneously cited as 1960 and no further study has corrected it. In Ptilophora, a single species, P. rufula Kobayashi, 1994, was described from Taiwan from two males (both designated as type) collected in Siyuanyakou (1800 m), northern Taiwan; no additional records have been reported since then. Based on recently collected specimens from Taiwan, we here reassess the status of yui Okano. The result suggests that the Taiwanese population should be regarded as distinct species, H. yui stat. nov. In addition, the female of P. rufula is described for the first time.

    <authors>Enrico Tronchin, T. Samaai, R. J. Anderson, J. J. Bolton</authors>
    <abstract>SUMMARY  Sponge–seaweed associations in the seaweed genus  Ptilophora  are poorly understood; therefore, 94 specimens, representing all 17 species of  Ptilophora , were examined to detail this phenomenon. All but 2  Ptilophora  species were shown to produce surface proliferations, with 13 species found to have sponge associations. Evidence for facultative sponge epiphytism was found with species–specific interactions being unlikely. Results show that surface proliferations are not induced by sponge epiphytes, as they often occur in the absence of sponge epiphytes, and vice versa. The significant number of proliferate thalli found with sponge epiphytes suggests that there is a likely relationship between the presence of surface proliferations and sponge infestation. Sponge epiphytes and  Ptilophora  species appeared structurally related in that the sponge probably exploits a niche habitat provided by the alga, for which surface proliferations might aid the sponge in bonding to the alga.</abstract>

    <title>Diversity and systematics of Ptilophora (Gelidiaceae, Rhodophyta)</title>
    <year>2006</year>
    <authors>E. Tronchin, J. J. Bolton, R. J. Anderson</authors>
    <abstract>Ptilophora Kützing (Rhodophyta) is an algal genus containing 16 species that are predominantly temperate and known mostly from deep subtidal habitats. The genus generally has an Indian Ocean distribution, although two species are found in the north-west Pacific, two in the south-west Pacific, and one in the Mediterranean. Observation of type specimens, specimens from type localities and a thorough review of literature on this genus was carried out to create a comprehensive review of Ptilophora and provide further insight into some poorly understood species. A key to the species in this genus and a distribution map are included, as well as a description and photographic plate of each species. The type species Ptilophora spissa (Suhr) Kützing, only collected once in history, is placed in synonymy with P. diversifolia (Suhr) Papenfuss, having been found to be an aberrant morphology of the latter species. An epitype is designated for P. diversifolia since the lectotype (a figure) cannot be used for detailed studies. Ptilophora beckeri Holmes is reassessed and confirmed to be an unusual reproductive morphotype of P. pinnatifida J. Agardh. Similarly, Phyllophora aegei Giaccone is reassessed and confirmed to be a synonym of Ptilophora mediterranea (H. Huvé) R.E. Norris. The cystocarpic phase of P. rumpii (Dickinson) R.E. Norris and the male phase of P. pterocladioides Andriamampandry are reported here for the first time, and for P. helenae (Dickinson) R.E. Norris and P. leliaertii Tronchin et De Clerck new data on their distributions are added.</abstract>

    <abstract>SUMMARY  The rare red alga  Schimmelmannia  (Schimmelmanniaceae, Acrosymphytales) from Japan was taxonomically re‐examined in this study. Japanese  Schimmelmannia  has previously been identified as  S. plumosa  (Setchell) I.A.Abbott. However, Japanese  Schimmelmannia  and  S. plumosa  have approximately 5 and 1.9% of genetic distance in mitochondrial  cox 1 and chloroplast  rbc L sequences, respectively. They also differ morphologically in the numbers of periaxial cells and auxiliary cell branches indicating that they are distinct species. Based on molecular phylogenetics and morphology,  S. benzaiteniana  is distinguishable from other  Schimmelmannia  species, except for  S. bollei  Montagne which lacks a detailed description. Since  S. bollei  has been reported only from the North Atlantic coast of Africa, we assumed that it is distinct from the Japanese species. We, therefore, described the Japanese species as a new species,  S. benzaiteniana .</abstract>

    <abstract>Проведена оценка динамики численности, внешнего вида клеток, флуоресценции хлоропласта и зеленой автофлуоресценции клеток (ЗАФ) динофлагелляты Prorocentrum foraminosum при воздействии тяжелых металлов: кадмия Cd2+, никеля Ni2+ и свинца Pb2+ в концентрациях 10 и 20 мкг/л. Показано, что все металлы в изученных концентрациях оказали ингибирующее влияние на численность клеток: наименьшее воздействие оказал Cd2+. Морфологически клетки не изменялись при воздействии Cd2+, Pb2+, а при добавлении Ni2+ отмечена деформация клеток. Флуоресценция хлоропласта изменялась при воздействии металлов, за исключением Cd2+. В целом, ЗАФ не изменялась при наличии в среде Cd2+, увеличивалась при добавлении Ni2+, снижалась – Pb2+. Предложено использовать ЗАФ для экспресс оценки токсичности веществ и качества вод.

    <authors>Alison R. Sherwood, Amy L. Carlile</authors>
    <abstract>The marine red algaSchimmelmanniacf.eleganswas identified from samples collected from an aquaculture facility on the island of Hawai'i based on morphological and molecular data analyses. The genus has never before been reported from the Hawaiian Islands. Awareness of this species is raised given that it has been suspected as introduced in Cape Town, South Africa, and because Hawaiian coastal marine waters are already heavily impacted by introduced algae.</abstract>

    <abstract>Schimmelmannia venezuelensissp. nov. (Gloiosiphoniaceae, Rhodophyta) is described on the basis of sexual plants collected from the State of Vargas, Venezuela. This material had previously been identified asSchimmelmannia plumosa(Setch.) I.A. Abbott but has been observed to have a post-fertilization development that differs from all other species of the genus for which post-fertilization details are known. Because there is a direct fusion between the carpogonium and the auxiliary cell after fertilization (unlike the fertilized carpogonium undergoing one or more transverse divisions prior to contact with the auxiliary cell as in otherSchimmelmanniaspecies), the Venezuelan plants are described herein as a distinct species.</abstract>

    <title>Extraction of Protein and Bioactive Compounds from Mediterranean Red Algae (Sphaerococcus coronopifolius and Gelidium spinosum) Using Various Innovative Pretreatment Strategies</title>
    <year>2024</year>
    <authors>Jihen Dhaouafi, Naima Nedjar, Mourad Jridi, Montassar Romdhani, Rafik Balti</authors>
    <abstract>In this study, the release of proteins and other biomolecules into an aqueous media from two red macroalgae (Sphaerococcus coronopifolius and Gelidium spinosum) was studied using eight different cell disruption techniques. The contents of carbohydrates, pigments, and phenolic compounds coextracted with proteins were quantified. In addition, morphological changes at the cellular level in response to the different pretreatment methods were observed by an optical microscope. Finally, the antioxidant capacity of obtained protein extracts was evaluated using three in vitro tests. For both S. coronopifolius and G. spinosum, ultrasonication for 60 min proved to be the most effective technique for protein extraction, yielding values of 3.46 ± 0.06 mg/g DW and 9.73 ± 0.41 mg/g DW, respectively. Furthermore, the highest total contents of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and carbohydrates were also recorded with the same method. However, the highest pigment contents were found with ultrasonication for 15 min. Interestingly, relatively high antioxidant activities like radical scavenging activity (31.57–65.16%), reducing power (0.51–1.70, OD at 700 nm), and ferrous iron-chelating activity (28.76–61.37%) were exerted by the different protein extracts whatever the pretreatment method applied. This antioxidant potency could be attributed to the presence of polyphenolic compounds, pigments, and/or other bioactive substances in these extracts. Among all the used techniques, ultrasonication pretreatment for 60 min appears to be the most efficient method in terms of destroying the macroalgae cell wall and extracting the molecules of interest, especially proteins. The protein fractions derived from the two red macroalgae under these conditions were precipitated with ammonium sulfate, lyophilized, and their molecular weight distribution was determined using SDS-PAGE. Our results showed that the major protein bands were observed between 25 kDa and 60 kDa for S. coronopifolius and ranged from 20 kDa to 150 kDa for G. spinosum. These findings indicated that ultrasonication for 60 min could be sufficient to disrupt the algae cells for obtaining protein-rich extracts with promising biological properties, especially antioxidant activity.</abstract>

    <abstract>Seaweeds are a great source of compounds with cytotoxic properties with the potential to be used as anticancer agents. This study evaluated the cytotoxic and proteasome inhibitory activities of 12R-hydroxy-bromosphaerol, 12S-hydroxy-bromosphaerol, and bromosphaerol isolated from Sphaerococcus coronopifolius. The cytotoxicity was evaluated on malignant cell lines (A549, CACO-2, HCT-15, MCF-7, NCI-H226, PC-3, SH-SY5Y, and SK-MEL-28) using the MTT and LDH assays. The ability of compounds to stimulate the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and to induce mitochondrial dysfunction, the externalization of phosphatidylserine, Caspase-9 activity, and changes in nuclear morphology was also studied on MCF-7 cells. The ability to induce DNA damage was also studied on L929 fibroblasts. The proteasome inhibitory activity was estimated through molecular docking studies. The compounds exhibited IC50 values between 15.35 and 53.34 µM. 12R-hydroxy-bromosphaerol and 12S-hydroxy-bromosphaerol increased the H2O2 levels on MCF-7 cells, and bromosphaerol induced DNA damage on fibroblasts. All compounds promoted a depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, Caspase-9 activity, and nuclear condensation and fragmentation. The compounds have been shown to interact with the chymotrypsin-like catalytic site through molecular docking studies; however, only 12S-hydroxy-bromosphaerol evidenced interaction with ALA20 and SER169, key residues of the proteasome catalytic mechanism. Further studies should be outlined to deeply characterize and understand the potential of those bromoditerpenes for anticancer therapeutics.</abstract>

    <abstract>Nowadays, biofouling is responsible for enormous economic losses in the maritime sector, and its treatment with conventional antifouling paints is causing significant problems to the environment. Biomimetism and green chemistry approaches are very promising research strategies for the discovery of new antifouling compounds. This study focused on the red alga Sphaerococcus coronopifolius, which is known as a producer of bioactive secondary metabolites. Fifteen compounds, including bromosphaerol (1), were tested against key marine biofoulers (five marine bacteria and three microalgae) and two enzymes associated with the adhesion process in macroalgae and invertebrates. Each metabolite presented antifouling activity against at least one organism/enzyme. This investigation also revealed that two compounds, sphaerococcinol A (4) and 14R-hydroxy-13,14-dihydro-sphaerococcinol A (5), were the most potent compounds without toxicity towards oyster larvae used as non-target organisms. These compounds are of high potential as they are active towards key biofoulers and could be produced by a cultivable alga, a fact that is important from the green chemistry point of view.</abstract>

    <abstract>Marine biofouling is an epibiotic biological process that affects almost any kind of submerged surface, causing globally significant economic problems mainly for the shipping industry and aquaculture companies, and its prevention so far has been associated with adverse environmental effects for non-target organisms. Previously, we have identified bromosphaerol (1), a brominated diterpene isolated from the red alga Sphaerococcus coronopifolius, as a promising agent with significant antifouling activity, exerting strong anti-settlement activity against larvae of Amphibalanus (Balanus) amphitrite and very low toxicity. The significant antifouling activity and low toxicity of bromosphaerol (1) motivated us to explore its chemistry, aiming to optimize its antifouling potential through the preparation of a number of analogs. Following different synthetic routes, we successfully synthesized 15 structural analogs (2–16) of bromosphaerol (1), decorated with different functional groups. The anti-settlement activity (EC50) and the degree of toxicity (LC50) of the bromosphaerol derivatives were evaluated using cyprids and nauplii of the cirriped crustacean A. amphitrite as a model organism. Derivatives 2, 4, and 6–16 showed diverse levels of antifouling activity. Among them, compounds 9 and 13 can be considered as well-performing antifoulants, exerting their activity through a non-toxic mechanism.</abstract>

    <title>Cytotoxic Mechanism of Sphaerodactylomelol, an Uncommon Bromoditerpene Isolated from Sphaerococcus coronopifolius</title>

    <abstract>Marine natural products have exhibited uncommon chemical structures with relevant antitumor properties highlighting their potential to inspire the development of new anticancer agents. The goal of this work was to study the antitumor activities of the brominated diterpene sphaerodactylomelol, a rare example of the dactylomelane family. Cytotoxicity (10–100 µM; 24 h) was evaluated on tumor cells (A549, CACO-2, HCT-15, MCF-7, NCI-H226, PC-3, SH-SY5Y, SK-ML-28) and the effects estimated by MTT assay. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels and apoptosis biomarkers (membrane translocation of phosphatidylserine, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, Caspase-9 activity, and DNA condensation and/or fragmentation) were studied in the breast adenocarcinoma cellular model (MCF-7) and its genotoxicity on mouse fibroblasts (L929). Sphaerodactylomelol displayed an IC50 range between 33.04 and 89.41 µM without selective activity for a specific tumor tissue. The cells’ viability decrease was accompanied by an increase on H2O2 production, a depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase of Caspase-9 activity and DNA fragmentation. However, the DNA damage studies in L929 non-malignant cell line suggested that this compound is not genotoxic for normal fibroblasts. Overall, the results suggest that the cytotoxicity of sphaerodactylomelol seems to be mediated by an increase of H2O2 levels and downstream apoptosis.</abstract>

    <abstract>Recent studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes (DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052), but our current work only focus on ACE2, which is insufficient to support the conclusion of this paper. So the authors have withdrawn their manuscript whilst they perform additional experiments and analysis to test some of their conclusions further. Therefore, the authors do not wish this work to be cited as reference for the project.</abstract>

    <abstract>The fundamental professional roles of radiographers and radiologists are focused on providing benefit to patients with our skills, while maintaining their safety at all times. There are numerous patient safety issues in radiology which must be considered. These encompass: protection from direct harm arising from the techniques and technologies we use; ensuring physical and psychological well-being of patients while under our care; maintaining the highest possible quality of service provision; and protecting the staff to ensure they can deliver safe services. This paper summarises the key categories of safety issues in the provision of radiology services, from the joint perspectives of radiographers and radiologists, and provides references for further reading in all major relevant areas.This is a joint statement of the European Society of Radiology (ESR) and the European Federation of Radiographer Societies (EFRS), published simultaneously in Insights into Imaging [DOI:10.1186/s13244-019-0721-y] and Radiography (DOI: 10.1016/j.radi.2019.01.009).</abstract>

    <abstract>Objective Immunomodulation is a therapeutic technique that modulates the balance of cytokines in the body. In this regard, our experiment was conducted to investigate the potential effect of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;S. coronopifolius&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; crude extract in combination with low dose of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) on depression-like behaviors in female Wistar rats.Methods Sciatic nerve injury was employed to induce depression and intradermal injection of 0.02 mL of BCG per rat was administered to lead an activation of innate immune system. Daily intra-peritoneal injections of 25 mg algae extract kg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; body weight were performed for 14 continuous days. Forced Swimming (FS) and Open Field (OF) tests were conducted to assess despairing and spontaneous behaviors. At the end of the experiment, brain was removed to determine the activities of catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), whereas spleen and adrenals were used for the histopathological study.Results The combined treatment exhibited antidepressant-like activity in FST by reducing immobility time, without inducing any significant change in ambulatory behavior in OFT. The histological analyses of spleen and adrenal structure showed a conserved architecture.Conclusion The results suggested that algae extract produce an antidepressant-like effect in combination with low dose of BCG, which is possibly trigged by its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</abstract>

    <abstract>AsSphaerococcus coronopifoliusStackhouse (Gigartinales, Rhodophyta) is a seaweed that has considerable potential for commercial uses, and as its life history in the various seas where it lives has not yet been thoroughly explored, we carried out a pilot study on the reproduction in nature and in vitro culture of field specimens established on the coasts of the Lazio region (Tyrrhenian Sea, central Italy). Spermatangia were not observed on the gametophyte (S. coronopifolius) and the tetrasporophyte of the species (Haematocelis fissurata) was not found either in the study site or in culture. As the carpospores developed directly into the gametophyte, we may conclude that this species reproduces itself, in both the study site and in culture, through a direct-type life history. It may thus be possible to use the variety of the clonal individuals growing on the coasts of Lazio for a future cultivation ofS. coronopifoliuson a large scale.</abstract>

    <abstract>Cancer and infectious diseases continue to be a major public health problem, and new drugs are necessary. As marine organisms are well known to provide a wide range of original compounds, the aim of this study was to investigate the bioactivity of the main constituents of the cosmopolitan red alga, Sphaerococcus coronopifolius. The structure of several bromoditerpenes was determined by extensive spectroscopic analysis and comparison with literature data. Five molecules were isolated and characterized which include a new brominated diterpene belonging to the rare dactylomelane family and named sphaerodactylomelol (1), along with four already known sphaerane bromoditerpenes (2–5). Antitumor activity was assessed by cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative assays on an in vitro model of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2 cells). Antimicrobial activity was evaluated against four pathogenic microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Compound 4 exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity against S. aureus (IC50 6.35 µM) and compound 5 the highest anti-proliferative activity on HepG-2 cells (IC50 42.9 µM). The new diterpene, sphaerodactylomelol (1), induced inhibition of cell proliferation (IC50 280 µM) and cytotoxicity (IC50 720 µM) on HepG-2 cells and showed antimicrobial activity against  S. aureus (IC50 96.3 µM).</abstract>

    <abstract>Methanol,n-hexane and dichloromethane extracts of twelve marine macro-algae (Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta and Heterokontophyta divisions) from Peniche coast (Portugal) were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal activity. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by disc diffusion method againstBacillus subtilis(gram positive bacteria) andEscherichia coli(gram negative bacteria).Saccharomyces cerevisiaewas used as a model for the antifungal activity by evaluating the growth inhibitory activity of the extracts. The high antibacterial activity was obtained by theAsparagopsis armatamethanolic extract (10 mm–0.1 mg/disc), followed by theSphaerococcus coronopifoliusn-hexane extract (8 mm–0.1 mg/disc), and theAsparagopsis armatadichloromethane extract (12 mm–0.3 mg/disc) againstBacillus subtilis. There were no positive results againstEscherichia coli.Sphaerococcus coronopifoliusrevealed high antifungal potential forn-hexane (IC50= 40.2 µg/ml), dichloromethane (IC50= 78.9 µg/ml) and methanolic (IC50= 55.18 µg/ml) extracts againstSaccharomyces cerevisiaegrowth. The antifungal potency of theSphaerococcus coronopifoliusextracts was similar with the standard amphotericin B.Asparagopsis armataandSphaerococcus coronopifoliusreveal to be interesting sources of natural compounds with antimicrobial properties.</abstract>

    <title>Antiviral Activities of Sulfated Polysaccharides Isolated from Sphaerococcus coronopifolius (Rhodophytha, Gigartinales) and Boergeseniella thuyoides (Rhodophyta, Ceramiales)</title>
    <year>2011</year>

    <abstract>Water-soluble sulfated polysaccharides isolated from two red algae Sphaerococcus coronopifolius (Gigartinales, Sphaerococcaceae) and Boergeseniella thuyoides (Ceramiales, Rhodomelaceae) collected on the coast of Morocco inhibited in vitro replication of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) at 12.5 µg/mL. In addition, polysaccharides were capable of inhibiting the in vitro replication of Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) on Vero cells values of EC50 of 4.1 and 17.2 µg/mL, respectively. The adsorption step of HSV-1 to the host cell seems to be the specific target for polysaccharide action. While for HIV-1, these results suggest a direct inhibitory effect on HIV-1 replication by controlling the appearance of the new generations of virus and potential virucidal effect. The polysaccharides from S. coronopifolius (PSC) and B. thuyoides (PBT) were composed of galactose, 3,6-anhydrogalactose, uronics acids, sulfate in ratios of 33.1, 11.0, 7.7 and 24.0% (w/w) and 25.4, 16.0, 3.2, 7.6% (w/w), respectively.</abstract>

    <title>Terpenes from the Red Alga Sphaerococcus coronopifolius Inhibit the Settlement of Barnacles</title>

    <authors>Veronica Piazza, Vassilios Roussis, Francesca Garaventa, Giuliano Greco, Vangelis Smyrniotopoulos, Constantinos Vagias, Marco Faimali</authors>
    <abstract>In this study, we screened eight terpenes isolated from the organic extract ofSphaerococcus coronopifoliusfor their antifouling activity in order to find possible new sources of non-toxic or less toxic bioactive antifoulants. The anti-settlement activity (EC50) and the degree of toxicity (LC50) ofS. coronopifoliusmetabolites was evaluated using larvae of the cirriped crustaceanAmphibalanus (Balanus) amphitrite(cyprids and nauplii) as model organism. For five of eight tested metabolites EC50was lower than 5 mg/L. The most promising results were observed for bromosphaerol (3), which expressed an EC50value of 0.23 mg/L, in combination with low toxicity levels (LC50&gt; 100 mg/L). The therapeutic ratio—an index used to estimate whether settlement inhibition is due to toxicity or other mechanisms—is also calculated and discussed.</abstract>

    <abstract>Abstract  Two naturally occurring diterpenes featuring unprecedented tetracyclic skeletons, ioniols I and II ( 1  and  2 , resp.), along with two previously reported metabolites  3  and  4 , were isolated from the organic extract of  Sphaerococcus coronopifolius  collected from the rocky coasts of Corfu island in the Ionian Sea. The structures of the new natural products, as well as their relative configuration, were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectral analysis, including 2D‐NMR experiments. The isolated metabolites were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against a panel of  Staphylococcus aureus  strains, which included multidrug‐resistant (MDR) and methicillin‐resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) strains.</abstract>

    <year>1983</year>
    <authors>R. H. Simons</authors>
    <abstract>Trematocarpus Kützing in southern Africa is found to comprise four taxa in three species: newly described is T.  fragilis (Ag.) De Toni var. divaricatus Simons, var. nov. Two of the species, T. flabellatus (J. Ag.) De Toni and T.  affinis (J. Ag.) De Toni are restored to independent specific rank after being regarded as synonyms of T.  scutellatus (Her.) Searles. It is shown that  Sphaerococcus (Chondrus) scutellatus Her., the basionym of  T.  scutellatus refers to a species of Gigartina, therefore a new combination Gigartina scutellata (Her.) Simons is made for this species which was formerly known as G. fastigiata J. Ag. and G. scabiosa (Kiitz.) Papenf. Trematocarpus elongatus Kiitz. is relegated to synonymy under T. fragilis var.  divaricatus.</abstract>

    <abstract>One of the most characteristic organisms of the Mediterranean flora, the endemic coralline  Tenarea tortuosa , has been collected along the Cretan coast and its vegetative and reproductive structures are reassessed. Gametophytes are described for the first time and are rare, observed only in one locality on the south coast. Reproductive structures suggest that the sexual life history is triphasic, but the present collections indicate unequal representation of males, carposporophytes and tetrasporophytes, and a dominance of bisporophytes suggesting that the alga is reproducing mainly asexually. The frond of  Tenarea  is formed by the coordinated growth of two elements (branches), growing back‐to‐back, each showing a simple  Titanodema‐type  of organization; i.e. a monostromatic hypothallium of sinuous cells and a single layer of obliquely borne epithallial cells. Contiguous cells of the two opposite branches are not connected by secondary pit‐plugs, and easily glide apart if decalcified. Natural splitting of the lamellae into its two branches may also occur, and single branches may fold regenerating the back‐to‐back organization. Analogous back‐to‐back growths occur in species of the distantly related genera  Goniolithon  (Lithophylloideae) and  Leptophytum  (Melobe‐sioideae) and apparently represent cases of convergence. The affinities of  Tenarea  to related genera are discussed.</abstract>

    <abstract>Проведена оценка динамики численности, внешнего вида клеток, флуоресценции хлоропласта и зеленой автофлуоресценции клеток (ЗАФ) динофлагелляты Prorocentrum foraminosum при воздействии тяжелых металлов: кадмия Cd2+, никеля Ni2+ и свинца Pb2+ в концентрациях 10 и 20 мкг/л. Показано, что все металлы в изученных концентрациях оказали ингибирующее влияние на численность клеток: наименьшее воздействие оказал Cd2+. Морфологически клетки не изменялись при воздействии Cd2+, Pb2+, а при добавлении Ni2+ отмечена деформация клеток. Флуоресценция хлоропласта изменялась при воздействии металлов, за исключением Cd2+. В целом, ЗАФ не изменялась при наличии в среде Cd2+, увеличивалась при добавлении Ni2+, снижалась – Pb2+. Предложено использовать ЗАФ для экспресс оценки токсичности веществ и качества вод.

    <title>North Aegean marine algae. III. Structure and development of the encrusting coralline Titanoderma cystoseirae (Rhodophyta, Lithophylloideae)</title>
    <year>2008</year>
    <authors>A. Athanasiadis</authors>
    <abstract>Vegetative and reproductive features of the encrusting marine alga  Titanoderma cystoseirae  are described on the basis of type specimens from the N. Adriatic Sea and new material from the N. Aegean Sea. Growth proceeds by means of two meristem types: a superficial meristem that occurs on terminal cells of hypothallial filaments, producing the hypothallium, and an internal meristem that is confined to cells just below the epithallium, producing the perithallium.  Subepithallial divisions occur in groups of cells that form distinct meristematic zones perpendicularly to the plane of radial thallus sections. These coordinated divisions originally appear on hypothallial cells close to the margin and subsequently spread centripetally, as opposed to the centrifugal growth of the hypothallial filaments. At least two subepithallial meristematic zones occur at a time on the thallus and both spread centripetally and in sequential pattern, each producing a new layer of perithallial cells that gradually covers the preceding (underlying) one. This elaborate process of perithallial ontogeny seems to be a distinctive characteristic for  T. cystoseirae.  Coordinated subephitallial divisions with different developmental patterns, however, are also observed in other coralline algae, particularly in members of the Lithophylloideae and the Amphiroideae. These observations support the hypothesis of the close phylogenetic relationship between these taxa but also emphasize the need for further studies before taxonomic implications can be proposed.</abstract>

    <abstract>Проведена оценка динамики численности, внешнего вида клеток, флуоресценции хлоропласта и зеленой автофлуоресценции клеток (ЗАФ) динофлагелляты Prorocentrum foraminosum при воздействии тяжелых металлов: кадмия Cd2+, никеля Ni2+ и свинца Pb2+ в концентрациях 10 и 20 мкг/л. Показано, что все металлы в изученных концентрациях оказали ингибирующее влияние на численность клеток: наименьшее воздействие оказал Cd2+. Морфологически клетки не изменялись при воздействии Cd2+, Pb2+, а при добавлении Ni2+ отмечена деформация клеток. Флуоресценция хлоропласта изменялась при воздействии металлов, за исключением Cd2+. В целом, ЗАФ не изменялась при наличии в среде Cd2+, увеличивалась при добавлении Ni2+, снижалась – Pb2+. Предложено использовать ЗАФ для экспресс оценки токсичности веществ и качества вод.

    <abstract>Vegetative and reproductive features of the encrusting marine alga  Titanoderma cystoseirae  are described on the basis of type specimens from the N. Adriatic Sea and new material from the N. Aegean Sea. Growth proceeds by means of two meristem types: a superficial meristem that occurs on terminal cells of hypothallial filaments, producing the hypothallium, and an internal meristem that is confined to cells just below the epithallium, producing the perithallium.  Subepithallial divisions occur in groups of cells that form distinct meristematic zones perpendicularly to the plane of radial thallus sections. These coordinated divisions originally appear on hypothallial cells close to the margin and subsequently spread centripetally, as opposed to the centrifugal growth of the hypothallial filaments. At least two subepithallial meristematic zones occur at a time on the thallus and both spread centripetally and in sequential pattern, each producing a new layer of perithallial cells that gradually covers the preceding (underlying) one. This elaborate process of perithallial ontogeny seems to be a distinctive characteristic for  T. cystoseirae.  Coordinated subephitallial divisions with different developmental patterns, however, are also observed in other coralline algae, particularly in members of the Lithophylloideae and the Amphiroideae. These observations support the hypothesis of the close phylogenetic relationship between these taxa but also emphasize the need for further studies before taxonomic implications can be proposed.</abstract>

    <abstract>Two members of the Lithophylloideae (Corallinales):Pseudolithophyllum fuegianum(Heydrich) Mendoza &amp; Cabioch andTitanoderma conspectum(Foslie) Woelkerling, Chamberlain &amp; Silva have been reinvestigated on the basis of their anatomical and reproductive features. This allows a new reassessment of these two taxa. Comments on their vertical distribution and abundance are also given.</abstract>
